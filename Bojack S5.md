为什么约翰·菲尔伯特的家看起来和我的一模一样Why does John Philbert's house look the same as my house?
我从未去过你家I've never been to your house.
场景这样设计是为了映衬菲尔伯特警探的特点The set was designed to reflect Detective Philbert.
俭朴 孤僻 在自我隔离的孤山上摇摇欲坠Spare, lonely, precariously balanced on a hill of his own isolation.
有点像大卫·伯伦纳兹的房子It kind of looks like David Boreanaz's house.
场景设计师去那里参考过The set designer actually took a tour there.

一定要菲尔伯特听着他死去老婆的录音is it necessary that Philbert can only orgasm if he's listening
才能性高潮吗 对to a recording of his dead wife's voice? Yes.
好吧 那第八页这个呢Okay, well, what about this thing on page eight
他去脱衣舞俱乐部 坐在后座拿个素描本where he goes to a strip club and just sits in the back with a sketchpad
画脱衣女郎 还放着伦纳德·科恩的歌and draws the strippers, while a Leonard Cohen song plays?
这怎么了吗What about it?
主要是这些半裸女人It's just that all of these halfnaked women.
我当然能理解啦I mean, I understand it.
就是担心这会显得女性廉价 男性至上I'm just worried it might come across as gratuitous and, malegazey,
实际上肯定不是which I know it isn't!
这样好了 你们可以回家了You know what? You girls can go home.
脱衣女郎的戏取消The stripper scene's cut.
不要啊 搞什么No. Seriously?
我怎么养活我的宝宝啊How am I gonna feed my baby?
我刚想到更好的点子I just got an idea for something better.
不画裸体脱衣女郎 你画裸体的吉娜吧So, instead of drawing strippers naked, you're just going to draw Gina naked.
吉娜 波杰克担心之前的戏有女性廉价 男性至上之嫌Gina, BoJack was concerned the old scene was gratuitous and malegazey.
真的吗 波杰克自己说的吗He was? BoJack said that?
这样更有意思 而且角色更发自内心This is much more interesting and motivated by character.
既然是角色发自内心 就不算廉价And since it's motivated by character, that means it's not gratuitous.
谢谢你的建议 波杰克 帮大忙了Thank you for the note, BoJack, you really helped.
对 谢谢你帮忙 波杰克Yeah. Thanks, BoJack, for helping.
能拿冰块来吗Can we get some ice?
能给吉娜的乳头来点冰吗Can we get some nipple ice for Gina?
你就是大名鼎鼎的尤兰达 我不出名So, you're the famous Yolanda. I am not famous.
你应该是把我跟其他尤兰达搞混了You might have me confused with another more famous Yolanda.
我是说 托德经常跟我说起你I know, II just meant because Todd talks about you so much,
你在我这里很出名I feel like you're famous.
好吧 之前没说清楚Well, that was not clear.
好吧 托德 你怎么不说话Okay. Todd, why don't you say things now?
史蒂夫 你还在修卡车吗Steve, you still fixing up your truck?
你说的是艾米丽前男友 消防员史蒂夫·迪·马可You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend, firefighter Steve D'Marco.
我是消防员史蒂夫·迪·马兹奥 我们不一样Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio. We're very different.
虽然我的确有辆卡车 而且最近在修But I do have a truck, and I'm fixing it up.
谢谢你关心So, thanks for asking.
我创建了约会软件 让消防员认识我I created a dating app for firefighters to meet me.
好像很有效 是的Looks like it worked. Yeah.
我们应该为禁欲系创建一个约会软件We should create a dating app for asexuals.
禁欲系为什么会想要约会软件Why would asexuals want a dating app?
禁欲不代表不浪漫Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.
你这么想Think of it this way.
一个人可以 A浪漫 或 B不浪漫One could be: A, Romantic, or B, Aromantic,
同时又 A有性欲 或 B禁欲while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.
你可以是BB或BASo you could be BB, or BA.
我就是AB 懂吗As for me, see AB, see?
虽然只有百分之一的人是禁欲系So, even within the one percent of the population that's asexual,
在寻找另一半的there's an even smaller percentage
比例更小that is still looking for romantic companionship.
好像这个软件的用户群体有点小啊Seems like a pretty thin user base for an app.
但要是没有 禁欲浪漫主义者最后会将就But without it, asexual romantics might end up settling for just whatever
跟随便碰到的禁欲浪漫主义者在一起 就算没任何共同语言other asexual romantics they might meet, even if they have nothing else in common.
不管怎样... 可能这是好事Well, anyway... Yeah, but maybe it's good
要是没有共同语言 他们可以互助成长if they have nothing in common because then they can help each other grow
逐渐改变 成为更健全更丰满的人and change, and become fuller, more wellrounded people.
倒也没错Yeah, that's true.
托德 你还在做疯狂的小丑牙医工作吗So, Todd, are you still doing that rabid clowndentist exercise thing?
没有了 小丑都逃跑之后就搞不起来了Oh no, that whole thing kinda fell apart when the clowns got loose.
是你杀了你老婆 菲尔伯特 我会证明的I know you killed your wife, Philbert, and I'm gonna prove it.
别把我指控成杀人犯 马隆Don't finger me for a murderer, Malone.
不知道你哪来的证据I don't know where those fingers have been.
要是我证明给你看呢Well, how about I show you?
切Cut!
有人一直在哇哇乱叫Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh."
你们在这里做羞羞的事情You guys are doing a bangup job over here.
猿人之王 凯撒如是说So sayeth Caesar! King of the apes!
听着兄弟 我知道你在干嘛Look, man, I know what you're doing, okay?
你就是想惩罚我 但别拉上吉娜You're trying to punish me. Just don't punish Gina.
我没在惩罚任何人I'm not trying to punish anyone.
我就想做一个史无前例精彩卓绝的作品I'm just trying to make a good show that's brilliant and unprecedented.
你们俩好像不在一个频道上It sounds like you guys are basically on the same page.
你才是那个有问题的人You're the only one with a problem here.
吉娜没有意见 吉娜有意见Gina is fine with it. Gina is not fine with it.
你们俩说的基本一样啊You guys, you're almost saying exactly the same thing.
除了有人多个"没"字Except one of you is saying "not".
吉娜 你对全裸出镜有意见吗Gina, do you have a problem with the nudity in this scene?
我觉得很好 史无前例 精彩卓绝 我去吃点土豆It's great. It's brilliant, unprecedented. I'm gonna get some potatoes.
看到了吗 大家都没问题 除了你You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.
可以住口了吗So, can we drop it?
我知道你曾是现场最重要的人I know you're used to being the most important person on set.
跟我没关系 你好奇怪This is not about me. It's weird for you
我不想听that I don't need to listen.
我没有...I'm not...
但要是你真有建设性意见But if you actually have notes that are helpful,
你别把老二晃来晃去 我会听的I would love to hear them when you're done swinging your dick around.
跟我的老二没关系 好了 朋友们...No, this is not about my dick. Okay, fellas...
可能真的跟你老二有关系 什么Well, maybe it should be about your dick. What?
既然你这么担心男性视角Since you're so concerned about the male gaze,
那我们让女性来看看吧let's give the females something to gaze at.
就给你正面全裸镜头We'll do a fullfrontal nude scene with you.
这就是妥协 这是合作This is compromise! This is working together.
等等 全裸出镜 菲尔伯特举起双手Well, hold on. Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up
装灯泡 真棒with both hands to screw in a light bulb. Yes!
他在小板凳上踏着小碎步转圈He totters in little circles on a tiny stool.
我不是转手腕就好了吗 全身旋转 让大家看到全部Wouldn't I just turn my wrist? Full body rotation. We see everything.
终于好好说话了Now we're talking!
并没有 卡洛琳... 我赞成No, we're not! Princess... I'm on it.
弗利普 波杰克要穿T恤Flip, BoJack can only do this scene
才能演这段戏 什么if he can wear a Tshirt. What?
他很在意自己的腹部He's very selfconscious about his belly area.
不 我在意的是我的丁丁No, I'm selfconscious about my penis area.
他不能穿T恤He can't wear a shirt.
他要展示脆弱之处It's about being vulnerable.
我们要看到他松弛身体上的每一处皱纹和缺陷We see every fold and imperfection of his wrinkled, saggy body.
过分了 这样大家才会喜欢他Hey! So we like him.
他必须完全勃起 这样大家才会尊敬他But he has to be fully erect so we respect him.
什么 我们明天拍摄What? We'll shoot it tomorrow.
好 除非你不喜欢这主意Yeah. Unless you don't like this idea,
那我们就换回原来的方案in which case, we can go back to what we were doing before.
对 这...Right. Well
那你就要承认你完全不在乎So, you would be admitting that you don't actually care
物化女性 你只是给我提意见about the male gaze and you were only giving me notes
强调自己的话语权to hear yourself talk.
事实并非如此 对吧But that's not it, right?
对 很好Right. Great.
明天下午拍摄 好的Shooting is tomorrow afternoon. Okay.
今晚我给你寄脱毛套装 菲尔伯特要脱毛I'll send the waxing kit over tonight. Philbert waxes?
不是为了美观 他只是为了感受Not for cosmetic purposes. He just wants to feel something.
我喜欢你的朋友 她创业能力令人佩服I like your friend. It's impressive how she creates companies.
她男朋友的工作也很有趣And her boyfriend has an interesting career as well.
是啊 你的工作也很有趣Yeah! And you have an interesting career.
你们三个的工作都很有趣Hey! The three of you all have interesting careers.

不会 我换个说法No. Let me rephrase that.
你没有明确人生方向让我感到奇怪I feel weird that you have no discernible life direction.
我是说...I mean...
我要告诉别人什么{\fs}[怎么介绍你]{\r} 讲个故事 说个笑话What am I supposed to tell people? A story? A joke?
人们有的时候喜欢听赞美之词Compliments are things people like being told sometimes.
对不起 你今天咋样 你去见那只青蛙了吗I'm sorry. How was your day? Did you end up meeting with that frog?
没有 我就呆在家上上网No, I just stayed home and looked at stuff on the Internet.
你好 卡洛琳公主Hello, Princess Carolyn.
你不是卡洛琳公主 你为什么不是卡洛琳公主You're not Princess Carolyn. Why are you not Princess Carolyn?
她回家很晚 我白跑一趟了She gets home pretty late. I came all this way for nothing?
我都带上了旋转椅和全套装备I brought my spinny chair and everything!
如果你想找点事情做 你可以帮我找个工作Well, if you want something to do, you could help me find a job.
你在找工作 我找了一天了You're looking for a job? I spent all day looking!
首先 我觉得该在报纸上找工作First, I thought I should get a newspaper to find a job.
然后我就想 "我要去哪里找报纸"but then I was,?like, "Where do I find a newspaper?"
然后我就开始查So, I looked it up.
找到一张本地的地图And a map came up of my local area.
然后我觉得我对本地非常熟悉So, then I thought about how I know this area pretty well,

因为我觉得 这谁都想的出来Because I feel, like, it kinda came out of the room.
当你进楼时 你说你想去洗手间When you get in the building, say you need to use the bathroom.
然后你溜进其中一个高层的办公室Then you'll sneak into the office of one of the network execs.
上他们的邮箱 发一封邮件给弗里浦·麦克维克Go into their email and send a message to Flip McVicker
告诉他他不能再拍裸体镜头了telling him he can't film any more nude scenes
因为毫无创意也没有必要because they're derivative and unnecessary,

弗利浦 我们得谈谈 好的Hey, Flip, we need to talk. Okay.
我不要拍裸戏 什么I'm not doing the naked scene. What?
你写这场戏就是来羞辱我的The only reason you wrote it is to embarrass me.
波杰克 我为我的电视剧写剧本BoJack, I'm not writing scenes for my television show
并且指导拍摄不是为了给你上课and also directing them in order to teach you lessons

你为什么总是要找麻烦 是我在找麻烦Why do you keep making it so difficult? I'm making it difficult?

因为这很蠢 整部剧就很蠢Because it's dumb! This whole show is duuuuuuumb!
什么What?
它难以理解 矫揉造作 打光还很暗It's confusing, it's overwritten, and it's poorly lit.
黑暗是黑暗的隐喻The darkness is a metaphor for darkness!
最糟的是 它很无聊And worst of all, it's boring!
它没有主题 连这点都表达不清It has nothing to say, and it says that nothing badly!
我来告诉你这里的规矩Let me tell you how this is going to be.
我是剧本创作者I am the show creator
如果我要你的角色裸体出镜 他就得裸体出镜and if I want your character to get naked, he gets naked.
如果我要他说韩语 他就得学韩语If I want him to speak only in Korean, you're learning Korean.
如果我要你的角色在裤子里拉屎If I want your character to shit his pants
并且这季剩余时间裤子里都装着便便and walk around with shit in his pants for the rest of the season,
你也得照做you will do just that.
拜托 你签了合同Oh, come on. You signed a contract.

你得取悦你的上帝You will please your god,
如果我没在片场看见你全裸 我们就法庭见and if I don't see your ass on set then I will see your ass in court.

为什么每次勾搭当地人都没好结果Why does this happen to me every time I go on location?
去越南的第九个理由Reason number nine to go to Vietnam:
脱离日常生活对你有好处Because it's good to get out of your routine.
这是不是跟第五条重复了 脱离你的舒适区Is that similar to reason number five: get out of your natural habitat?
不 不一样的 没事No, it's a different thing. It's fine.
无所谓It's whatever.
嘿 你在这干嘛呢Ooh, hey. What are you doing here?

基本上是我这么想的 但我的治疗师也...It was mostly me who thought it, but my therapist also...
你脖子变长了吗Did you get a longer neck or something?
我脖子没变长 是这发型I did not get a longer neck. It's a haircut.
我的脖子看着长了吗 没 Does it make my neck look long? No.
你看起来很美Uh, you actually look amazing.
别因为我现在就脆弱就想占我便宜Don't try to take advantage just 'cause I'm all vulnerable right now.
老天 女士 我只是在赞美你Jesus, lady! I'm just trying to give you a compliment!
放松点 我开玩笑的 是吗 Relax, I was joking. Were you?
我们去派对吧 天啊 你真是一团糟 Let's just go to the party. God, you're all over the place.
你讨厌派对 我不讨厌派对 You hate parties. I don't hate parties.
你讨厌派对 我很有趣的 当我没说过 You hate parties. I'm fun. Okay, you know what? Forget this.
抱歉 波杰克...I'm sorry. BoJack...
你的发型很好看 花生酱先生会喜欢的Your haircut looks great. Mr. Peanutbutter's gonna love it.
你好啊 戴安 你好 Hey, Diane! Hey.
你的脖子真好看 我没有... I love what you did to your neck. I didn't...
你看到那冰雕了吗Did you see that ice sculpture?
我绝对不会去舔的 放心I am definitely not going to lick it. Don't worry.
好吧Okay.
反正我等会儿就走Anyway, I can't stay long
因为我要去旱冰场because I'm supposed to go to the roller rink later.
希望那里没有I hope, there won't be
黑帮老大any mob bosses there.
我在说什么 这也太出人意料了What am I saying? That's so random.
你看见花生酱先生了吗 我没看见 你去书房看过了吗 Have you seen Mr. Peanutbutter? I don't know. Did you check the library?
好了 我得走了'Kay, I gotta go.
我要去寄信 我要舔一下邮票There's a letter I wanna send. I need to lick the stamp.
希望我穿上旱冰鞋之前Hopefully, I'll remember to do it
会记得这事... 好的 before I put my roller skates on... Okay.
这样我就不会不小心舔空So I don't accidentally miss the stamp with my tongue
然后伸着舌头滚下楼梯and then roll down the stairs with my tongue out
然后舌头直接撞上冰雕and then smack right into the ice sculpture with my tongue.
那就糟糕了 但我很有可能犯蠢That would be pretty bad, but I wouldn't put it past me.
这些都是谁Who are all these people?
花生酱先生 你在这里 戴安 你这发型真好看 Mr. Peanutbutter. There you are! Diane, nice haircut!
是吗 才没有... 是的 Oh, this? No, I didn't... Yeah!
这让你的脖子看起来... 像脖子It really brings out the neck of your... neck.
好吧 这...Okay, well, that's...
别走好吗 我要跟你谈谈Hey, don't go anywhere, okay? I want to talk to you.
对了... 艾丽卡 Oh. How was... Erica!
你带着儿童棺材来干什么What are you doing here with a childsized coffin?
天啊 你还好吗 我都看到了Oh, my God, are you okay? I saw everything.
我没事Yeah, I'm fine.
在离婚这事上我没法站边I can't pick sides in this divorce
因为我是你们俩的好朋友because I'm good friends with the both of you,
但你要知道 不管发生什么 我都会在你身边 也会在他身边but I want you to know, no matter what, I'm here for you and also there for him.
如果你需要什么 告诉我And if you ever need anything, just let me know
我会是你的支柱 只要不耽误我and I'll be your rock, as long as it doesn't conflict with me
同时做花生酱先生的支柱 或者工作also being Mr. Peanutbutter's rock, or my work,
我忙得脚不沾地which is keeping me very busy.
抱歉 我必须接一下Excuse me, I have to take this.
弗里浦 确定需要脱衣舞俱乐部场景吗Hi, Flip? Yeah, are we sure we need this strip club set?
因为一旦付了定金 就不能退款了Because once we put the deposit down, we cannot get that money back.
第十个去越南的理由:Reason number ten to go to Vietnam:
只有离开才能回家Because you've gotta leave to come back home.
你好 你好 Hello? Hey.
抱歉 我之前太奇怪了 我过得不太好I'm sorry. I've been so weird. I'm going through some shit.
我知道I know.
我现在真的很需要一个朋友Yeah. And I just really need a friend right now.
你懂我意思吗You know what I mean?
一个朋友A friend?
我明白Yeah. I get it.
谢谢你Okay. Thanks.
对了我是戴安 阮 This is Diane, by the way. Nguyen?
嗯 阮Yeah. Nguyen.
你不确定回家之后的生活会是什么样You're not entirely sure what life will be like when you get home,
但那也是件好事 因为一切皆有可能but maybe that's good because that means anything could happen.
天啊 你是劳拉·琳妮 大家总是这么说 Oh, my God, you're Laura Linney! People say that to me all the time.
没错 我就是劳拉·琳妮And it's true. I am Laura Linney.
抱歉打扰了 但我必须问一下I'm so sorry to bother you, but I have to ask,
你在拍的电影 结局是什么样的the movie you were filming, what happens at the end?
你离婚了 然后去越南寻找自我 然后呢You get divorced, you go to Vietnam to find yourself, but then what?
结果怎么样How does it work out?
我确实找到了自己Well, I do find myself.
我的克隆人My clone.
而且她和我前夫同居了And she's shacked up with my ex.
我妒火中烧 用大砍刀将他开膛破肚I fly into a jealous rage and gut him with a machete,
那时我才意识到but not before realizing that this whole thing
一切都是上头的阴谋goes all the way to the top.
所以我和我的克隆人组队去了迪拜So me and my clone have to team up and head to Dubai.
很多情节都是在铺垫续集 你明白的A lot of it is setting up the franchise. You know how it is.
这是一部动作片 也是爱情片 Um... it's an action movie? And a love story.
我和我的克隆人还有一场火辣激情戏Me and my clone have a steamy makeout scene,
香艳又前卫which is hot but also very progressive.
不好意思 能给我拿点椒盐卷饼吗 我是劳拉·琳妮Excuse me. Can I get some pretzels? I'm Laura Linney.
那些理由都不是你去越南的真正理由But none of those reasons are why you actually went to Vietnam.
你好 陌生人Hey, stranger.
所以 如果你和你的律师没有意见Yeah, so, if it all looks good to you and your lawyer,
你可以签字 然后正式生效了you can sign it, too, and then it'll be official.
离婚任务完成 真棒 Divorce completed. Yay!
我们做到了 没想到吧 我们的婚姻 We did it. Take that, our marriage!
那我们下次见 嗯 Well, I guess I'll see you around? Yeah.
我是想要... 抱歉你是... Oh! I was going for the... Oh, sorry. Did you...?
抱歉 又来了一遍Sorry. Just go all the way.
再见 好 Well, bye. Cool.
戴安 等等 我有事要告诉你Diane, wait. I actually have something to tell you.
我... 不知道怎么说比较好 但是...I... don't know the best way to say this, but...
我和别人在一起了I'm seeing someone.
谈恋爱那种Romantically.
那人不是你Who isn't you.
好像这么说不太好That was probably not the best way to say it.
总之 像我说的那样So, as I was saying,
陪在你身边是我现在最...being there for you right now is my top pri...
等等 斯图尔特Oh. Hold on. Stuart!
我桌子下面有个灭火器 就是它起火了 那样的话...There's a fire extinguisher under my desk. Oh, that's what's on fire? In that case...
你去越南的真正原因The real reason you go to Vietnam
是因为你不小心看到你的准前夫is because you accidentally see your soontobe exhusband
在和别人接吻kiss someone else.
最开始你觉得 "只是放纵一下 他们喝醉了 这是场派对"At first you think, "Oh, it's a fling. Whatever, they're drunk, it's a party."
但他用手搂住了她的腰But he puts his hand on the small of her back
就像他以前搂着你exactly the way he used to do to you.
这代表着 "你是我的"It means "I've got you,"
当他搂着你 你觉得很安全and when he did it to you, it made you feel safe.
你意识到他不会再对你这么做了And you realize he will never do that to you again.
这再一次让你心碎...And it breaks your heart, again...
哪怕你早已心碎一地after your heart was so broken that you thought
以为它不可能再被碾碎it could never get any more broken.
你以为自己安全了You thought it was safe,
但总有再次心碎的方法but it still, somehow, finds a new way to break.
因为哪怕提出离婚的是你Because, even though, you're the one who asked for this,
真正分开后 你彻底失去了依靠now that you've got it, you are completely adrift
没有指南针 没有地图 不知道要去哪 去做什么with no compass, or map, or sense of where to go, or what to do.
所以你就去了越南So you go to Vietnam.
你以为在那里可以找到亲人 对更大的东西有归属感You think you might find community, a connection to something bigger,
但是... 你没有but... you don't.
事实上 你比离开前更孤独了In fact, you feel even more alone than you were before you left.
但... 你会撑过去But... you survive.
你知道了你可以一个人You learn that you can survive being alone.
我真为你高兴 花生酱先生I'm really happy for you, Mr. Peanutbutter. 

## 第三集 

最重要的是I think, the most important thing here
我们对彼此和自己都坦诚 你同意吗is that we're honest with each other and ourselves. Do you agree?
算是吧Yes?
报告说你上次有六项健康检查不合格It says, here, you failed your last six health inspections.
怎么还在工作How are you still in business?
大概是精神力量 或者说身残志坚I wanna say moxie? But possibly spunk.
我竟然在你家睡着了I can't believe I fell asleep at your house.
拍夜戏打乱了我的生物钟 晚上六点才起很可怕 These shoots are messing up my rhythm. It's so weird waking up at : p.m.
别担心 我不会养成在你家过夜或过日的坏习惯Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit of spending the night or day.
我知道 我们一起拍戏 一起做爱I get it. We work together, we make sex together,
闭口不谈感情we don't talk about feelings,
但有时表面上毕恭毕敬会变成...and yet sometimes a begrudging respect can blossom into...
打住 "变成啥都不是" Nope. "Blossoms into nothing"
我本来想这么说is what I was gonna say.
你打断我 太傻了You cut me off, so you look stupid.
你睡觉的样子才傻 看 我拍了些蠢照Well, you look stupid when you sleep. Look, I took some dumb pictures.

是内部人士才知道的隐藏菜单It's an offthemenu item for those in the know.
显然 我是波杰克 还经常点波杰克三明治Obviously, I'm BoJack and I always order the BoJack sandwich.
听起来好蠢That's kooky.
为什么你跟三明治的名字一样Why would your name be a sandwich name?
因为这家店是我的 而且我是明星Because I own this restaurant and I'm a celebrity.
难道 所有三明治都叫明星的名字吗So, are all sandwiches named after celebrities?
鸡肉沙拉是明星吗Is chicken salad a celebrity?
不是 那只是三明治的一种夹心No, that's just a thing they put in the sandwich.
不是什么人的名字That's not someone's name.
有冲突吗 我就叫酸黄瓜Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.

我当副群主 我没在约会 I call vice president. I'm not dating anyone.
大胆猜测 你也没有And if I had to guess, I'd say neither are you.
城里的男人 尤其是那些明星 都不会安定下来Guys in this town, especially celebrities, are not exactly the settledown type.
所以我走桃花运了 他对我是真心的That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy. He doesn't have a problem committing.
其实 他刚第三次离婚In fact, he just got out of his third marriage.
一个刚离婚的明星 好吧 他不会伤你心的A celebrity who just got divorced. Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.
你觉得我和花生酱先生进展太快了吗Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter and I are moving too fast?
我不认识你 也不清楚你的感情I don't know you or your relationship,
但我也经历过几次{\fs}[在街区徘徊过]{\r}but I have been around the block a few times.
我还演过ABC的剧"街区" 电视上播过I was even on an ABC procedural, called The Block, which aired a few times.
关键是不抱期望 你就不会失望The key is to have zero expectations, and then you'll never be disappointed.
对 不抱期望Yeah, zero expectations,
这道理同样适用于这家店which also seems to be the mantra of this restaurant.
谢谢Thank you.
她好像死了She looks dead.
但我不是医生 只是个粗鲁的警察But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.

我觉得可以啊I think it works.
约翰·菲尔伯特不按常理出牌 他会把舞台指导大声说出来John Philbert doesn't play by the rules. He says his stage directions out loud.
让观众措手不及 显得这戏大胆前卫It's confusing, which means the show is daring and smart.
想不想去感受特别服务Hey, wanna go check out craft services?
你耳机里的东西怎么会比How could whatever you're listening to be more fun

但细节每次都不一样but the specifics are what keep it fresh each time.
准备走了吗 是的 Are you ready to go? Yeah.

我换身衣服 不用 穿西装吧 I'll go change. No, keep your suit on.
我对象是管理层 能给爸妈留下个好印象My parents are gonna be impressed I'm dating an executive.

就像柯特妮·考克斯在熟女当道的森林里As Courteney Cox said when she discovered a rotting corpse in the woods
发现一具腐烂的尸体时说 "主啊 我希望你不忙"near the Cougar Town set, "Good God, I hope you're not busy."

而我妻子是一个全球知名的成人电影明星and my wife is a worldfamous, adult, film star,

小时候 我妈带我去百老汇看了"一粒真相"When I was a little girl, my mom took me to see A Kernel of Truth on Broadway.
当时很火It wasn't a big hit.

弗兰克·里奇还真是个婊子 没说错吧That Frank Rich could be a real frank bitch, am I right?
我当时才六岁 感到非常震撼Well, I was six and it blew my mind.
我的童年都在幻想去百老汇唱歌I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day, getting to sing on Broadway.
但是 我猜我不够好But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.
所以现在我接稳定的电视工作 这不错 我也觉得不错So now I get steady TV work, which is fine, and I'm fine,
但是我还是听那部歌剧but I still listen to that musical
因为能让我回忆起激情岁月because it reminds me of a time when I was less jaded,
那时我相信自己无所不能 这种回味感觉不错when I believed I could do anything, and that makes me feel good.
天呐 吉娜Oh, my God, Gina.

这... 甚至更搞笑了 噢 And that... that's even funnier! Oh!

我就是不明白你为什么要这么做I just don't get why you're doing this.
我们需要一位大明星 戴安We need a big star, Diane.
不 戴安说得对No, Diane's right.
我就是大明星 我不是这意思 I'm the big star. That's not my point.
一山不容二虎You can't have two stars.
所有一流的侦探节目都是围绕一名重要的All the greatest detective shows are focused around a central,

卡洛琳公主 如果你雇了这个人Princess Carolyn, if you hire this guy,

奶酪盘Hey! Cheese plate!
万斯·魏格纳...Vance Waggoner!
在原谅大会 马男严正拒绝为万斯鼓掌Horseman forcefully forgoes applause for Vance at Forgivies!
菲尔伯特片场是否内生龃龉Is a feud forming on the Philbert front?
全城都在议论此事That's the buzz around town,
所有人心中都有一个疑问and the question on everybody's mind is,
"为何要摆脸色""Why the strong face?"
他摆脸色是为了抗议He made the face in protest
{\an\bord\fs\b}摆脸色
抗议万斯对阿拉斯加原住民的评论because of what Vance said about native Alaskans.
波杰克很明显是对万斯·魏格纳BoJack's clearly upset about the time Vance Waggoner
说马德里爆炸案是"种族大杂烩"表示不满said the Madrid train bombings were "A real mixed bag."
还记得那次万斯把女店员锁在酒店房间里Remember when Vance locked that shopgirl in a hotel room
还一边大喊着"我精力四射"and said, "I've got pizzazz"
一边自慰着射进香槟酒杯里吗while masturbating into a champagne flute?
因为波杰克可记得Because BoJack remembers.
该死的God damn it!
这次活动的目的是要让大家忘记我的过去The whole point of the award was to put the past behind me.
但现在就因为这蠢货的二逼脸But now, because of this idiot's dumb face,
我的过去成了大家的谈资了my past is all anyone's talking about!
别人都在鼓掌 你怎么就不能鼓掌呢Everyone else was clapping. Why couldn't you clap?
哥们 颁奖典礼应该上更好的奶酪才对Hey, man, awards show should've had better cheese.
告诉你 我的公关都要气炸了My publicist is furious, by the way.
公关真吓人啊Ooh, spooky publicist!
可别让她的气刃伤到我Hope she doesn't papercut me with her mad press release.
我们会处理好的We're gonna handle this.
波杰克会上电视BoJack will go on TV
解释这个奶酪误会门and explain this unfortunate faux pas du fromage.
对不对 波杰克 好吧 Won't you, BoJack? Ugh. Fine.
英雄波杰克再一次为大家收拾烂摊子Once again, hero BoJack will clean up everyone else's mess.
你好 陶德Hello, Todd.
你有注意到我刚刚走进来时没有敲门吗Did you notice how I just walked in without knocking?
很强硬吧Pretty tough, huh?
一点都不Not at all!
对我来说这是友好亲切的意思To me, it read as amiable and familiar,
就好像我们的友情亲密到连门都不用关似的like our friendship has an assumed "Open door" Policy.
该死的God damn it! Owie!
显然好莱乌的制片人觉得我不够强硬Apparently, Hollywoo producers don't think I'm tough enough
演不了坏人角色to play the bad boy parts.
不 陶德 你是我认识的最强硬的人 Oh, no! Todd, you're the toughest guy I know.
你能教我怎么变强硬吗Will you teach me how to be tough?
还以为你永远都不会问I thought you'd never ask.
因为我完全不知道你出了这种状况Because I had no idea this was happening to you.
{\an\bord\fs\b}嘎嘎而谈
波杰克 澄清一下 为什么对万斯甩脸色BoJack, clear the air. Why'd you give Vance the face?
会场上的奶酪...Well, there was this cheese
而你乳糖不耐受And you're lactose intolerant,
这让你想到了万斯对世事都"不耐受"吗which reminded you that Vance lacks tolerance?
不 是因...No, it
奶酪是孤立的The cheese stands alone,
但女性面对性骚扰时but no woman should stand alone,
不应该各自各自为战 是吗when standing up to sexual harassment?
嘎嘎 不 跟这些事都没关系 Squawk! No, it wasn't any of those things!
你是说不是这些事So, you're saying it wasn't any one thing,
那是许多事情积累导致的more of an accumulation?
不... 波杰克 真难以置信 It BoJack, it is really incredible,
你会表态反对和自己联袂主演的人your taking a stand against your costar.
不 我没有表态No, I'm not taking any stand
这个人掐了他妻子的脖子I mean, the guy choked his wife,
而好莱乌上下都毫不关心 都在支持万斯and most of Hollywoo is, like, "No biggie. Good for him!"
嘎嘎 好吧 显然他掐妻子脖子 Squawk! Okay, well, obviously it's not good
是不对的he choked his wife.
不不不No, no, no!
我并没有试图发表什么大胆的宣言I wasn't trying to make some bold statement or anything.
只是想说掐妻子脖子是不对的It's just that... choking your wife is bad.
真的假的Really?
好吧Okay.
我只想说 听到有男性说这种话真了不起Can I just tell you how amazing it is to hear a man say that?
帕洛玛 总得有人表态吧Well, Paloma, someone needed to take a stand.
就算我疯一回 老波杰克提议Call me crazy. I mean, this is just old BoJack talking,
我们不要再掐任何女人了好不好but how about we don't choke any women?
至理箴言啊 不要掐女人So true, right? Don't choke women!
不要掐女人Don't choke women!
波杰克说得对BoJack is right.
好莱乌不应该让施虐者合法化Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers,
不该让他们出演那些by allowing them to star in movies and TV shows,
表现他们问题人格的电视剧和电影that play off their problematic personas!
好莱乌不该让施虐者合法化Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers
不该让他们出演那些by allowing them to star in movies and TV shows
表现他们问题人格的电视剧和电影that play off their problematic personas!
好的 嘎嘎 All right! Squawk!
说到痛揍女性And speaking of battering women,
广告之后right after the break,
我们将教你如何制作完美的蓝莓馅饼we'll show you how to make the perfect blueberry pancake.
与骄傲的女权主义者马男波杰克一起With proud feminist, BoJack Horseman.
不要离开Stick around!
不要掐女人And don't choke women!
为什么你一次又一次地How is it you consistently
做跟我的要求背道而驰的事do the opposite of the thing I need you to do?
我不知道 卡洛琳公主I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
有没有可能我一直以来Is it possible, this whole time,
都是一名无人知晓的女权主义英雄呢I've been an amazing feminist hero, and nobody knew it?
波杰克 感觉不错 BoJack! Feels pretty right.
我是个男性女权主义者 不用谢 社会Yeah, I'm a male feminist. You're welcome, society.
我要给万斯打电话 好 I gotta call Vance. Okay.
我就待在这 保持清醒I'm just gonna stay here, being woke.
万斯 听我说 波杰克已经非常脱水了Vance! Listen, BoJack's been very dehydrated.
不 不 不 你不能用那套No, no, no. You can't use the old
"脱水使他愚蠢"的老套路对付我 "Dehydration made him stupid" trick on me.
好吗 我是脱水使我愚蠢专家Okay? I'm Mr. DehydrationMadeMeStupid.
波杰克真的想和你一起共事 他刚刚...BoJack really wants to work with you. He just got caught up
无所谓 反正我不拍了Doesn't matter. I'm not doing the show.
什么 你说得对 What? You were right.
只需要一个邀约All it took was one offer.
一旦放出风我要拍菲尔伯特Once word got out I was doing Philbert,
其他的邀约就跟风而来了all the other offers started pouring in.
你签约了You signed a contract!
拜托Oh, please.
我跟一个岁的孩子发色情短信I sexted a yearold
还是得到了人道主义奖and still got a Humanitas Prize.
你觉得我不会违反跟报时网站签下的合同吗You think I can't get out of a contract, with a time website?
顺便 我真的还是很抱歉By the way, still very sorry
和岁的孩子发色情短信about sexting that yearold.
卡洛琳公主 你有注意到作为一个女人Hey, Princess Carolyn, you ever notice how, as a woman,
你的客户每赚一美元你才能赚到十美分吗you only make ten cents for every dollar your clients make?
真的很耐人寻味Really makes you think, huh?
波杰克 我错了 你是对的BoJack, I was wrong, you were right.
我们搞垮那个混蛋吧Let's take that asshole down.
现在你想搞垮他了So, now, you wanna take him down
因为他不拍你的剧了Now, that he's not doing your TV show, anymore?
戴安 别这么愤世嫉俗Diane, don't be cynical.
我愤世嫉俗 你想让我说什么 I'm cynical? What do you want me to say?
我被自己想要成功的欲望蒙蔽了双眼I got blinded by my desire to see myself succeed,
因为我是个女人 一个真正的女权主义者which, since I'm a woman, is actually very feminist.
但现在万斯不能帮我成功But now that Vance can't help me succeed,
我意识更富有女权主义的事I realize the more feminist thing to do
是确保他也不能成功is to make sure he doesn't succeed either.
我愤世嫉俗 我是在伸出橄榄枝 I'm cynical? I'm offering an olive branch, here.
这座城市喜欢万斯这样的混蛋Look, this town loves assholes like Vance.
我们无能为力There's nothing we can do.
这座城市就像舞会之夜的处女一样不坚定This town is as wishywashy as a virgin on prom night.
让他们听女人的话只需要All they need to listen to women
用正确的声音 一个男人的声音is the right voice a man's voice.
所以我才在这里吗Is that why I'm here?
是的 我把你俩聚在一起Yep. I brought you two together
因为你的女权主义脑子和你的蠢男人脸because between your feminist brain and your stupid manly face,
能够说出人们会听的话you can actually say things that people will listen to.
有道理 大家的确有一直听我说什么That's a good point. People do listen to me all the time.
有一次我发推"安息吧 大卫·博韦"One time I tweeted "RIP David Bowie,"
现在大家都觉得他死了And now everyone still thinks he's dead.
大卫·博韦是死了 真的吗 天啊 David Bowie is dead. Wait, for real? Oh, man.
那么通过波杰克So, through BoJack,
我可以对广大观众说我想说的I can say whatever I want, to a huge audience,
而不必被称为"尖锐刺耳"或者"唠叨"without being called "Shrill," Or "Naggy,"
或者"经典戴安式言论"Or "Classic Diane."
是的 大家都爱男性女权主义者Yeah. Everyone loves a male feminist.
原来一直以来女权主义的问题症结就是It turns out, the problem with feminism, all along,
并不是男人发起的is it just wasn't men doing it.
我们没那么尖锐刺耳We're much less shrill.
是啊 真是全世界的女人的好日子Yeah, this is truly a great day for women everywhere.
我怎么能让人们觉得我是个强硬的坏家伙Okay, how do I make people think I'm a tough bad boy,
一个不在乎社会宝贵规则的人who doesn't give a care about society's precious rules?
每次万斯·魏格纳不守规矩Every time Vance Waggoner breaks the rules,
都会被拍到 就这样 it gets caught on camera. That's it!
我们只需要一些证明我很强硬的视频证据We just need some video evidence of me being tough!
给 拍下来Here, record this.
给我来一根吧 硬汉 抱歉 兄弟 Hey, got one for me, toughie? Sorry, bud.
现在还不用道歉Not yet, you're not.
但是你等下肯定会后悔[道歉]的But you can bet your candy ass you're gonna be.
搞...What the?
你要说什么What do you say to that?
太谢谢你了 什么 Thank you. So much. Huh?
两周前 我埋葬了我父亲 肺癌Two weeks ago, we buried my father. Lung cancer.
我宝贝女儿让我保证不再抽烟了My baby girl made me promise I'd quit smoking,
但我一直在偷偷抽这些慢性自杀的玩意but I've been sneaking these suicide sticks this entire time.
不抽了 那是我最后一支烟了No more. That was my last cigarette.
谢谢 你真是个大好人Thank you, you sweet, sweet soul.
你真是个亲切 平易近人的人You are truly a kind and approachable character.
还强硬And tough?
很难[强硬]不去爱你 你个大笨蛋Tough not to love, you big galoot!
气死我了Oh, banana bread!
好吧...Okay, just...
流行文化能让事物变得标准化Okay, so, pop culture inherently normalizes things,
这是一把双刃剑and that power works both ways.
可以定为好的标准It can normalize things for good,
{\an\bord\fs\b}媒体界\N流行文化
比如跳舞的艾伦让like how dancing Ellen makes
{\an\bord\fs\b}好
美国中产阶级不再那么惧怕同性恋人群middle America less afraid of gay people.
但也可以是坏的But it can also normalize things for bad,
{\an\bord\fs\b}坏
像杰克·鲍尔为严刑逼供折磨人所做的like what Jack Bauer did for torture,
或者像吉米·法隆对口型假唱上所做的or what Jimmy Fallon did for lipsyncing.
所以当我们给像万斯·魏格纳So, when we give a platform to known abusers
这样的知名的施虐者平台 那是...like Vance Waggoner, that's an example of...?
定为...Normalizing things for...?
好还是坏 抱歉 Good or bad? I'm sorry.
我知道你很努力想不无聊I know you're trying really hard not to be boring,
的确有一点不无聊了and it's kind of not boring,
但我还是觉得我在受到说教but it still mostly feels like I'm being lectured at.
好吧... 等等 Okay, well Hold on.
让我想象一下如果是我在说Let me imagine that I'm saying it.
感觉好多了You know what, that's a little better.
社会对男性的标准是非常低的Well, the bar for men is depressingly low.
就说一些像Just sprinkle in a few words
像"交集性"或"微攻击"之类的词like "Intersectionality" or "Microaggressions"
微天下新闻就会授予你年度最佳女权主义者and Vice News will name you Feminist of the Year.
我应该穿一件写着"女权主义最棒"的T恤吗Oh, should I wear a Tshirt that says "Feminism is Bae"?
姑娘们都喜欢那个 对吧Girls love shit like that, right?
听起来不错 波杰克Sounds great, BoJack.
你好 戴安 你是怎么上我的车的 Hello, Diane. How did you get in my car?
你没锁 这是普锐斯 会自动锁的 You left it unlocked. It's a Prius. It locks automatically.
普锐斯是自动解锁Priuses unlock automatically.
你还是要自己锁车的You still need to lock it when you get out.
真的吗 我知道你和你的小团伙 Really? I know you and your little Scooby gang
在密谋对我客户不好的事are plotting something against my client,
我想让你停止and I want you to stop.
那个混蛋当然会请安娜·皮塔饼 Of course that dirtbag would hire Ana Spanakopita.
万斯过去做得不好Vance has a troubled past.
他只想要一个全新的开始All he's asking for is a fresh start.
不 为什么他总能有机会 他悔过了 No. Why does he get that over and over? He's reformed.
你还希望他做什么呢What else would you have him do?
假如说你可以让他做任何事Let's say, you can make him
来弥补当年的过错do anything you want to make things right.
你会让万斯·魏格纳做什么What would you make Vance Waggoner do, now?
什么都不会做 我觉得他无法弥补Nothing. I don't think he can make things right.
既然这样 那你希望达到什么目的呢Well, then, what do you hope to accomplish, here?
你就不能承认吗Can't you just admit to me,
就我们私下里说 这种行为很烂just between the two of us, that this sucks?
你可以说这是你的工作You can say it's your job,
或者你相信"原谅" 无所谓that you believe in "Forgiveness," whatever,
但难道你就没有一点点觉得but don't you at least a little bit think
如果让万斯这样的人逍遥法外that when we let guys like Vance off the hook...
戴安 你作为一名女性 Diane. ...when you, as a woman,
以你的友谊为恶毒的男人打掩护give awful men the cover of your friendship,
因为你为他们工作when you work for them.
首先 他们不会变好First of all, they're not gonna get better.
其次 你就成了共犯Second of all, you are then complicit...
不 应该说他们的行为你难辞其咎no, you're culpable for the terrible things they do.
你说完了吗Are you done?
大家都是女人 你就不能承认这很糟糕吗Just, woman to woman, can't you admit this is screwed up?
你这番话得让我好好消化一下You've given me a lot to think about.
总的来说 蓝妹妹是女权主义形象吗So, in conclusion, is Smurfette a feminist icon?
{\an\bord\fs\b}女士们请注意 他也是女权主义者
我觉得更应该问 为什么一定要是呢I think the better question is, why does she have to be?,
我们有点跑题了We've gotten a little off track, here.
我们在聊万斯·魏格纳We were talking about Vance Waggoner.
对Oh, yeah!
其实今天早上We actually have a tape of
万斯召开了记者发布会 我们录下来了a press conference Vance gave, earlier today.
什么 而且他还提到了你 What? And he mentioned you in it.
这是《整到你了》吗 是在整我吗Oh, no, is this a Gotcha? Am I the gotcha?
来看看他说了什么吧Let's see what he had to say.
我有很重要的事要宣布I have an important announcement.
我 也是一名女权主义者I... am a feminist, too.
所以我不能参演That's why I had to walk away
马男波杰克的新剧《菲尔伯特》from BoJack Horseman's new show Philbert.
我看了他们寄给我的剧本 非常愤怒Okay, I read the scripts they sent me, and I was outraged.
毫无理由的性暴力 大量的色情裸露镜头Gratuitous sexual violence. Protracted, lascivious nude scenes.
也许马男波杰克觉得这很有趣Maybe BoJack Horseman thinks that's all in good fun,
但我知道这是毒瘤but I know it's toxic.
如果我参与其中 我就是共犯And if I took part in it, I would be complicit
不 我就难辞其咎no, culpable for that toxicity.
{\an\bord\fs\b}波杰克请注意 你被整了
波杰克 对于这些指控你作何回应BoJack, what do you say to those charges?
未来属于女性The future is female?
挺酷的吧Pretty cool, huh?
你确定要穿这身吗Uh, are you sure about this outfit?
强硬的男人都穿皮衣All the toughest guys wear leather.

只有时髦男孩能去Fancy boys only.
好吧 祝二位下午愉快Well, you two have a pleasant afternoon.

别再来了And stay out!
菲尔伯特杀了他的妻子吗So... did Philbert kill his wife?
萨西是这样认为的Well, Sassy thinks so.
所以她才假装当了他的新搭档That's why she's pretending to be his new partner,
为了查清真相to get closer to the truth.
同时 他的旧搭档弗里茨也回来了Meanwhile, his old partner Fritz is back in the mix,
但也许他已经死了 出现的只是but he might be dead and just a projection
由菲尔伯特的内疚造成的幻象of Philbert's lingering guilt.
感觉很不清楚 整个剧本都很乱 That's very unclear. Yeah, the whole thing's nonsense,
但重点是 怎么证明这剧本没有性别歧视but, more importantly, how do we prove it's not sexist?
确实有性别歧视 这是当然 It is sexist. No, of course.
但我马上要接受采访But right now, I have to do an interview
要解释剧本没有性别歧视where I explain that it's not,
否则就会显得我是一个伪君子because otherwise, I'll look like a hypocrite,
那这对世界各地的女性会很不好which would be really bad for women everywhere.
为了拯救女权主义So, in order to save feminism,
你得给我一些听起来很睿智的理由you need to give me some smartsounding reasons
说明《菲尔伯特》并不是表象上这样why Philbert isn't what it so obviously is,
我才能继续当英雄和榜样so that I can continue to be a hero and role model.
万斯对于剧本的评价都是对的Everything Vance said about these scripts is true.
整个剧本的架构It's posing as a deconstruction
完全就是无谓的大男子主义of the edifice of toxic masculinity...
无谓的大男子主义 好的Uhhuh. Toxic masculinity, yeah. Right.
但这仅仅是个借口But it's just using that,
真正的目的还是放纵享乐as an excuse to relish in its own excesses.
可最令人难过的是And the most depressing thing...
看这部剧的人is that ten times more people
比我任何文章的读者are gonna watch this show
都要多十倍than read anything I've ever written.
我觉得你的斗志似乎并不昂扬I feel you're not really getting into the spirit here.
我们还是可以扳倒万斯 打倒男权主义We can still take down Vance and topple the patriarchy.
拜托 我们支持女权主义 很有趣的Come on, we're doing feminism, it's supposed to be fun!
对我来说不有趣This isn't fun for me!
做女人不是我的兴趣或者业余爱好Being a woman is not a hobby or a pet interest of mine.

最近怎么样 听说你的电视剧性别歧视So, what's going on? Something about your show being sexist?
我的制片人给我打印了一篇文章My producer printed out an article for me,
但我没看but I did not read it.
显然如果你断章取义的话Look, obviously, when you take plot points out of context,
看上去的确会有歧义they can seem unsavory.
但它们都是用来But they're all part of a larger attempt
解读...有毒的...男性气概to deconstruct... toxic... masculinity.
听起来很美妙Sounds glamorous!
不 我们没有美化 事实就是这样No, we're not glamorizing it, that's the thing.
你不应该喜欢上约翰·菲尔伯特You're not supposed to like John Philbert
或者赞同他所做的事or agree with the things he does.
这是一部电视 没有美化任何事It's a TV show. It doesn't glamorize anything.
但...也许会标准化But... maybe it normalizes it.

不 你说得对 是我们保下了这种人No, no. You were right. We give these men cover.

所以才叫"来自"That's why they call it "From."
那我马上就要"来自"这段对话了Okay, I'm about to be from this conversation.
等下 抱歉 我们谈一谈花生酱先生好吗Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Can we just talk about Mr. Peanutbutter?
你为什么让他上镜 大家都喜欢他Why did you cast him on this show? Everybody loves him.
我才应该是人见人爱的那个 我是菲尔伯特I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love. I'm Philbert.
我给剧组买了一辆快餐车So then I got a food truck for the crew
挂了个牌子写着"来自你们最爱的明星"with a big sign that said, "From your favorite star,"

我们可以电话联系的We could've just talked on the phone.
我想见到你本人I wanted to meet you in person.
这就是我卡洛琳公主与众不同的风格That's the Princess Carolyn difference.
我还从没见过Ooh! I've never met a person
名字里带"与众不同"的人呢who had a difference named after them before.
这很重要 我们是来讨论你孩子的事的Well, this is important. We're here to talk about your baby.
我知道你怎么想 又是一个愚蠢的青少年I know what you're thinking; another dumb teenager,
喝得烂醉 忘了确认so liquored up, she forgot to make sure
她男朋友带了套套her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.
这都是事实 但我也不是什么无知少女Well, that's all true, but I'm not some backwoods hick.
我岁 有大好人生等着我去享受I'm , I got my whole life ahead of me,
而我男朋友又没有要死要活求我嫁给他and it's not like my boyfriend's begging me to marry him.
男朋友很少这么干Boyfriends rarely do.
他叫斯踹 丹尼斯的简称 懂 His name's Strib, short for Dennis. Uh, sure.
他不是什么爱玩浪漫的人He's not exactly the romantic type,
但他那双眼睛 一看到就让人欲罢不能but he's got those eyes you just can't say no to,
你懂我意思吗you know what I mean?
我祝你和斯踹能一起享受很多年没孩子的时光I hope you and Strib have many happy childfree years, together.
我愿尽我所能I'm willing to do whatever I can
帮你达成"没孩子"这一部分to help contribute to the childfree part.

听着 我知道弗利普想让我当"那个女人"Hey, listen, I know Flip just wants me to be "The woman",
闭嘴别说话 但这部剧完全狗屁不通and keep my mouth shut, but this show makes no sense.
在屋顶摩托那场戏里In the rooftop motorcycle scene,
弗里茨和菲尔伯特一直在说Fritz and Philbert keep saying,
"这太危险了""This is so dangerous."
"是啊 哥们 我们真的很危险""Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."
但然后他们就从摩托上下来了But then they just get off the motorcycles.
他们为什么没向楼边漂移Why aren't they skidding towards the side of the building,
然后在摩托车掉下楼顶时and then they roll off just as
从车上翻身而下呢their bikes go careening over the edge?
好 行吧 去朝弗利普吼Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.
不管我说什么他都给我否了Everything I pitch, he shoots down.
这只是因为这主意不是他提出来的That's just because it's coming from someone who isn't him.
要是你想让他喜欢你的想法If you want him to like your idea,
让他以为是他自己想出来的就好just convince him he thought of it himself.
你真觉得只要说是他的主意 他就会照做吗You really think he'll do it because I say it's his idea?
这是个很棒的主意 戴安That's a great idea, Diane.
谢谢 我去找他说Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.
非常抱歉 没关系 So sorry. No problem.
我得告诉你一下Um, just so you know,
我见过一些其他的候选者 大多都是夫妻I have met with some other candidates, mostly couples.

你最近一次回来是什么时候When's the last time you were here?

还是你们都只叫"披萨厨房"Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"
毕竟你们就在加州since you're in California?
我们叫"加州披萨厨房" 或者"加披"No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen," Or "CPK."
加披 你们城里人CPK? What kind of city person's
是有多忙 连全称都没空说too busy to say "California Pizza Kitchen"?

女孩心中的格林斯博罗海波因特大都会the Greensboro High Point metropolitan area out of the girl.
我男友要是能把他鸡鸡从女孩体内I wish my boyfriend would've taken his penis
"剔除"就好了out of the girl.
我是说他当时拔出来就好了Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.
我听懂了Yeah, no, I got it.

但我对此毫无怨言but, hey, I'm not complaining.
你有事吗 有啊 Did you have a question? Yeah.
我知道我的前妻也是编剧之一So, I know my exwife is in the writers' room.
我不想让她或其他人尴尬 所以I don't want to make things weird for her or anybody else, so...
我必须得按照剧本说台词吗do I have to do all the dialogue, as scripted,
还是可以来点自由发挥or can I have a little fun with it?
一般我是不会问的Normally, I wouldn't even ask,
但这次涉及到前妻的问题but because of the whole exwife of it all,
我想有必要确认下 如果我把台词都改了I figured I should just doublecheck that it's definitely okay
是完全没问题的if I change every single word.
我了解弗利普 还是照剧本演吧Knowing Flip, I would just stick to the script.
所以不要改剧本吗So, don't flip the script?
对 不要随便改弗利普[改]的剧本Exactly. Don't flip Flip's script.
双重否定That's a doubleflip.
你的意思是我还是该改了So, you're saying I should flip it?
我的意思恰恰相反I'm saying the exact opposite.
那就是改 好好地改 我要挂了 So, flip it. Flip it good. Okay, I gotta go.

你的摊位 在跳蚤市场 Your booth? At the flea market.
我买便宜衣服贴上钻之后再卖出I sell clothes I bought cheap and then bedazzled.
虽然没达到在大商场卖的水平I'm not saying I'm the Danville Target or nothing,
在跳蚤市场摆摆摊还是可以的but it's good enough for fleas.

我妈 本来是要来擦地板的My mom, well, obviously she was planning on cleaning the floors,
但我问她能不能让我来but I asked her if I could do it.
我想掌握所有的清洁窍门 将来就能I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade, so one day,
成为像她那样优秀的管家I can be as good a housekeeper as she is.
你为什么还住在这Why do you still live here?
为什么不搬到罗利和你爸一起住Why don't you go live with your dad down in Raleigh?
我的兄弟姐妹都走了All my sisters and brothers are gone.
如果我再走 妈妈身边就没人了If I leave, my mom's got nobody.
再说 我走了 谁帮你擦屁股Besides, if I go, who's going to keep you out of trouble?
你知道我是橄榄球队的吧Did you know I'm on the football team?
我知道啊 但你有机会上场吗I do know it. Are you ever gonna play?
没有行了吧 就你聪明Probably not, smartass.
除非我们队那个无敌四分卫受伤了Not unless the firststring quarterback gets hurt.
为什么你不是无敌四分卫Why aren't you the firststring quarterback?
你还不是无敌管家呢You're not even firststring housekeeper!
要不要我给你的鼻子来一记无敌拳Well, how about I firststring punch you in the nose?
别这样 淡定 淡定Oh! Okay, easy, easy.
我是想 如果我埋头苦干 耐心等待Look, I think if I just keep my head down and be patient,
终有一天教练会意识到我才是头号四分卫Coach will eventually realize I should be QB one, you know?
这办法烂透了That's a terrible approach.
你要勇于追求梦想You need to go after what you want.
你要飞向太阳 像阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特那样You gotta fly into that sun, like Amelia Earhart did.
什么 就像那部电影里那样 What? You know, like in the movie.
我就没见过谁像你这么爱看老电影的I never knew anybody who liked old movies as much as you do.
你才岁 根本就没见过什么人You're . You never knew anybody, period.
行行行Okay, okay.
但如果我不像自己想的那么优秀怎么办But what if I'm not as good a quarterback as I think I am?
没关系 你不用太优秀Doesn't matter. You don't need to be good enough.
你只需要让你的教练相信你够厉害就可以了You just need to convince your coach you're good enough.
对啊 知道吗Damn! You know what?
我明天就去和他聊 他不答应你就不走 I'll talk to him tomorrow. Don't leave until you get that yes.

他新想出来一个He's really excited about

他想明天就拍He wants to do it tomorrow,
但 弗利普就是创意十足 要挂了 but... That's Flip, full of ideas. Gotta go.
好吧 这部剧已经严重超支了Ok, well, the show is already way over budget
我的老板已经开始质疑了and my boss is starting to ask questions.
通常我是很喜欢问题的Now, normally, I love questions
因为问题可以让我思考because they're good for pondering,
但我觉得在商界but I guess in the corporate world,
有人发问 就是期待能有人回答when people ask questions, they expect someone to answer them.
而显然 "确实 真的需要好好想想"And, apparently, "Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"
不是他们想要的答案is not the kind of answer they're looking for.
再见 陶德Goodbye, Todd.
等等 还有一件事 说 Wait, one more thing. What?
你认为伊利湖会嫉妒苏必利尔湖吗Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealous of Lake Superior?

我要是你就会小心点 你什么意思 I'd be careful if I were you. What do you mean?
你以为我不知道是怎么回事吗Think I don't know what's going on?

能找得到带薪的实习了who was gonna get a paid internship.
妈 你该上床睡觉了Mom, you need to go to bed.
看 这就是你我之间的区别 卡洛琳公主See, that's the difference between you and me, Princess Carolyn.
我知道我的归属 这就是我的床I know where I belong. This is my bed.
不对 我的床在哪儿No, it's not. Where's my bed?
我知道我的归属I know where I belong.
喂 你不是说今天就回来了吗 Hello? I thought you were gonna be here today.
你在哪儿呢 出了点事 Where are you? Something came up.
好吧听着 花生酱先生亲自完成了所有特技Okay, well, listen, Mr. Peanutbutter's doing all his own stunts,
每次他翻个小跟头and every time he does a dumb little somersault,
大家就跟他是凯利·斯特拉格似的欢呼everybody goes nuts like he's goddamn Kerri Strug.
凯利·斯特拉格 你这比喻也太过时了Kerri Strug? You gotta update your references.
{\an\bord\fs\b}美国体操运动员
等世上再出个凯利·斯特拉格When the world sees the likes of Kerri Strug, again,
我会相应调整的I will adjust accordingly.
话说回来 我说我也想自己做特技Anyway, I said I wanted to do my own stunts, too,
但我对弗利普写的新戏一无所知but little did I know that Flip was writing a new scene,
他居然要让摩托车从五层楼顶上冲下去where a motorcycle falls off a fivestory building.
告诉他你不想做就是了Just say you don't want to do it.
我不能 因为我已经炒了我的特技替身I cannot do that because I already fired my stunt double,
所以我还需要你打电话叫他回来so I also need you to call him and get him back,
这会有点困难 因为我当时说的话很难听and that might be tricky, 'cause I was really brutal about it.
为什么 因为有人在看 Why? Because people were watching.
现在我需要你插手Now I need you to intervene
阻止我亲自做特技and forbid me from doing my own stunts,
我虽然表面上想演 但因为其实并不想演even though I want to, because I actually don't want to,
因为这需要我身强体壮because that would require me to be in good shape,
但我并非如此which we know I'm not,
要演特技不能害怕 而你我皆知我是个怂瓜and also not a coward, which we both know I am.
波杰克 还有 如果你能说 BoJack Also, if you could say
这是因为我这明星太重要 不能冒这种风险it's because I'm too important a star to take the risk on,
但花生酱先生可以亲自上阵but Mr. Peanutbutter can keep doing his stunts
因为他没那么重要 这样就太好了 谢谢because he is less important; that would be real cool, thanks.
好吧 我来处理Fine, I'll handle it!
快别跟小婊子一样叽叽歪歪了Just stop whining like a little bitch!
{\an\bord\fs\b}莎迪出品

我称之为"莎迪出品"I call it Madey by Sadie.
问题是衣裳都有点撑大了Problem is got a bunch of lookieloos.
大家都来试穿 但没人买Everyone's browsing, but no one's buying.
这跟别人买不买无关 而是看你如何卖It's not about people buying. It's about you selling.

你可不能买这件外套Whoa! Hey, you can't get that jacket.
为什么 我要买这件 Why not? I was gonna get it.

莎迪 只要你向人们推销时Sadie, you can sell anything,
别让他们感觉是在被推销货物if you just sell people the idea that
那么你什么都能卖出去they're not being sold to.
这还真是心机啊Wow! That's pretty manipulative.

## 第六集 

行了行了 看见你了 快上车吧Yes, yes, I see you. Get in. Get in.
你妈又在上演悲伤的独角戏了Your mother's having another one of her episodes.
昨天晚上她和几个闺蜜Last night, she went to see A Doll's House
去看了《玩偶之家》 今天就来了主意with a couple girlfriends, and now she has ideas.
我下午从内室出来的时候I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,
发现她不仅没有给我做午饭to discover that not only had she not made me lunch,
那可是我续命的食粮which is a meal I need in order to live,
更过分的是but she'd furthermore,
她把自己锁在卧室里 嚎啕大哭locked herself in the bedroom to weep... loudly.
女人哭是一回事Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,
但当她们的哭声but when they do it at such
大到隔着门都能听见的时候a volume you can hear it through the door,
你就知道她们这么做只是为了引起注意then you know they're doing it just for the attention.
总之 我最后成功地给自己搞了个三明治Anyway, I was able to cobble together a sandwich for myself,
所以我才是真正的主人公so, I'm the real hero of the story.
几个小时后It was a couple hours later
我意识到自己的小说写得太顺手了when I realized I was on a good run with my novel.
我文思如泉涌I had this really interesting
一个妙句连着写了好几页sentence that kept going for pages and pages,
我就想今天难得and I thought about how rare
状态能这么好it is to really get in the groove like that.
平常我是多么的难以集中How, most days, I can't concentrate
因为我的蠢儿子总是把电视开得巨大声because my idiot child is blasting the television,
突然我意识到 乖乖啊and it suddenly dawned on me; hot cock on a rock,
她都没去接那个鼻涕虫烦人精she never even picked up the little noise and snot factory!
所以 我来了 做你的好妈妈So, here I am, being your mother,
我知道这会让你which I know is giving you
对性别认知产生混乱的想法all sorts of mixedup ideas about gender,
特别是你的脑子还缺根弦少根筋的while your brain is still loose and stupid.
记住Just remember,
如果你将来成了基佬 并不是我的错if you become a queer later in life, this isn't my fault!
不许你在夜店里Don't you sing no songs in your
演出时唱什么"爹地就是妈咪"的破歌nightclub act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"
同时眼巴巴地望着一串缠在一块的珍珠项链while gazing longingly at a tangled string of pearls.
珍珠是女人戴的东西 波杰克Pearls are for ladies, BoJack.
珍珠是女人的东西Pearls are for ladies.
你知道周日是我的写作日You know Sunday is my writing day.
周日是我唯一可以和我的作品独处的日子Sundays are the one day that are just for me and my craft,
就这样 你和你那个黑洞般的妈and still, you and the black hole that birthed you
还要串通一气毁了它conspire to ruin it for me.
现在我该怎么办 回去继续写吗What am I supposed to do now? Just go back to writing?
我已经完全没状态了 这一天全毁了I'm out of the zone now, the whole day's shot!
都是因为你和那个哭哭啼啼的女人All because of you and that brittle wisp of a woman
你就不该让她成为你妈you made the mistake of making your mother.
不 这不是她的错No. It's not her fault.
毕竟她已经尽力了She's doing the best she can, after all.
只是 你不能指望女人It's just that... you can't depend on women.
你不能指望任何人You can't depend on anyone.
你迟早会明白的Sooner or later, you need to learn
没人会照顾你that no one else is gonna take care of you.
我在给自己做三明治的时候领悟了这个道理That's what I learned when I had to make my own sandwich.
你不能依靠别人 波杰克You can't rely on other people, BoJack.
现在知道对你有好处It's good for you to know that.
她能教会你这点说明还是个好妈妈And she's a good mother for teaching you that.
比起其他孩子 你已经赢在了起跑线上You've got a head start on most kids.
你其实很幸运You're actually very lucky.
谢谢呢Thaaaaank youuuuu?
{\an\bord\fs\b} 马男波杰克\N第五季 第六集
所以来的路上我顺道去了玩偶匣So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box, on the way here,
店里的女服务生对我说and the girl behind the counter said,
你好呀 你今天是不是过得很棒"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"
不是那种 你今天过得怎么样Not, "How are you doing today?"
而是充满期待 你今天是不是过得很棒No. "Are you having an awesome day?"
问得特别的矫情Which is pretty shitty because
好像我不同意她就是我的责任it puts the onus on me to disagree with her,
如果我没有过得"棒棒哒"like if I'm not having an "Awesome day,"
突然间我就充满负能量Suddenly I'm the negative one.
通常人们问我过得怎么样Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,
真相是我过得很糟糕the real answer is I'm doing shitty,
但我不能这么说but I can't say I'm doing shitty
因为我没有正当的理由过得很糟because I don't have a good reason to be doing shitty.
如果我说 糟心透了So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"
他们就会问 为什么 出什么事了Then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"
我就得回 不知道 全都不顺心吧And I have to be like, "I don't know, all of it?"
所以 当人们问我过得怎么样So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,
我通常都说 过得好极了I usually say, "I am doing so great."
但当玩偶匣的这个女孩But when this girl at the Jack in the Box
问我是不是过得很好时asked me if I was having an awesome day,
我想 今天我可以过得很糟糕I thought, well, today I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,
因为我有合适的理由today I have a good reason,
于是我对她说 我妈妈过世了so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."
然后她突然泪如泉涌And she immediately burst into tears.
我还得反过来安慰她 真是烦死了So, now I have to comfort her, which is annoying,
同时 我后面还排着一堆人and meanwhile, there's a line of people forming behind me,
用批判的目光瞪着我who are all giving me these real judgy looks
因为我把快餐店的女服务生说哭了because I made the Jack in the Box girl cry.
她放声大哭 嘴里说着"对不起 对不起"And she's bawling, and she's saying, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"
我就安慰 没关系 没关系and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.
我是说 并不是很好 就是没事I mean, it's not fine, but, you know, it's... fine.
我想点一份双层杰克堡套餐And I would like to order a Double Jack Meal,
我还得去别的地方and I've kinda got somewhere to be,
所以能不能擦干泪水 挥洒汗水做汉堡so maybe less with the crying and more with the frying, huh?"
然后女孩又道了一次歉And the girl apologizes, again,
她在我的套餐里加了根免费的油条and she offers me a free churro with my meal.
离开的时候我想 我吃了根免费的油条And as I'm leaving, I think, "I just got a free churro
就因为我母亲去世了because my mom died."
没人说过 妈妈过世后可以吃到免费的油条No one ever tells you when your mom dies, you get a free churro.
总而言之 我很抱歉Anyway, I'm sorry,
本来没打算 好吧that's not part of the... All right.
好吧 重新来 正式开始 Okay, here we go. Let's do this.
马男波杰克正在致悼词 开始吧Here I am, BoJack Horseman, doing a eulogy, let's go.
钢琴小哥 能不能给我来段管风琴华彩Hey, piano man, can I get like a, like an organ flourish?
很好 我本来还担心Nicely done. You know, I was a little worried
今天会没有合适的伴奏I wouldn't have the right accompaniment today.
我想这就是我母亲作为器官捐献者的好处I guess it's a good thing my mom was an organ donor!
{\an\bord\fs\b} organ兼有器官和管风琴之意
怎么不是管风琴What happened to the organ?
把喜剧效果留给专业人士来吧Why don't you leave the comedy to the professionals?
好吗 这是我母亲的葬礼 先生Okay? This is a funeral, sir, for my mother.
能否表现出一点尊重Can you show a little respect?
就这样吧I'll take it.
马男碧翠斯 她是谁 一生是怎样的 Beatrice Horseman, who was she? What was her deal?
首先 她是一匹马Well, she was a horse.
她生于年 死于年Uh, she was born in . She died in .
有一次 她去参加了一场游行One time, she went to a parade,
还有一次 她一口气抽完了一整支烟and one time, she smoked an entire cigarette in one long inhale.
我亲眼看到的I watched her do it.
真是个不可思议的女人Truly a remarkable woman.
这个女人度过了完满的一生Lived a full life, that lady.
直到人生尽头 大概就是现在吧Just, all the way to the end, which is, uh, now, I guess.
是不是很引人深思Really makes you think, though, huh?
这就是人生 Life, right?
时光匆匆 世事无常 奔向死亡Goes by, stuff happens. Then you die.
我到点了 你们听得好认真Well, that's my time, you've been great!
记得给服务员小费Tip your waitress!
我开玩笑的 这里没有服务员No, I'm just kidding around, there's no waitress.
但说真的 关于我妈我就说这些But seriously that's all I have to say about my mother.
没必要说死人的坏话不是吗No point beating a dead horse, right?
现在怎么办 我不知道 妈你有主意吗So... Now what? I don't know, Mom, you got any ideas?
有吗Anything?
妈Mom?
没有吗No?
没什么想说的吗Nothing to contribute?
要是为我骄傲就敲一下棺材板Knock once if you're proud of me.
我能说 能和我妈共处一室说个不停Can I just say how amazing it is to be in a room with my mother,
她不会让我闭嘴and I can just talk without
去给她倒酒 是多幸福的一件事吗her telling me to shut up and make her a drink?
妈 想让我闭嘴就敲一下棺材板Hey, Mom. Knock once if you think I should shut up.
不用吗 你确定No? You sure?
我可不想让你难堪I mean, I don't want to embarrass you,
这悼词是歌颂你的 不是歌颂我的by making this eulogy into a melogy,
所以说真的 如果你想让我坐下so, seriously, if you wanted me to sit down
让别人来讲话 就敲一下 我不会生气的and let someone else talk, just knock. I will not be offended.
不用吗 你的葬礼你说了算No? Your funeral.
话说 抱歉把你棺材盖合上了Sorry about the closed casket, by the way.
她想要敞着棺材盖的She wanted an open casket,
不过现在她死了 谁在乎她怎么想but, you know, she's dead now, so who cares what she wanted?
不 这话可不好听 抱歉No, that sounds bad. I'm sorry.
我想要是她能看到自己死后的样子I think that if she could've seen what she looked like dead,
她也会同意这样更好 她死相可糟了she'd agree it's better this way. She looked like this.
有点像气急败坏的恐龙玩偶Kinda like a pissedoff toy dinosaur.
入殓师没法让她合上眼睛The coroner couldn't get her eyes closed.
所以现在她的脸永远都是So, now her face is forever frozen
一副极度可怕和痛苦的表情in a mask of tremendous horror and anguish.
或者按我妈的说法 周二的表情Or as my mom called it, Tuesday!
周二 我妈称之为周二Tuesday! My mom called it Tuesday.
妈 你觉得这个笑话怎么样 你喜欢吗Hey, Mom, what did you think of that joke? You like that?
你从来都不在乎我演的喜剧You never did care for my comedy.
讲个故事Here's a story.
我十几岁时When I was a teenager,
我在高中天才秀上表演了一出喜剧I performed a comedy routine for my high school talent show.
有一件很帅的外套 我很想穿There was this cool jacket that I wanted to wear
{\an\bord\fs\b}美国演员 编剧 导演
因为穿上它我就像艾伯特·布鲁克斯because it would make me look like Albert Brooks.
我为那件外套存了几个月的钱For months, I saved up for this jacket,
但等我终于存够了钱but when I finally had enough,
我走进商店 那外套却不见了I went to the store and it was gone.
他们刚刚卖给别人了They had just sold it to someone else.
然后我回家告诉了我妈So, I went home and I told my mother.
她说 "算是给你个教训She said, "Let that be a lesson.
这就是心存期望的下场"That's the good that comes from wanting things."
她很擅长传授人生哲学She was really good at dispensing life lessons,
似乎所有的不幸到头来都是我的错that always seemed to circle back to everything being my fault.
但那之后 在演出那天But then, on the day of the talent show,
我妈给了我一个惊喜my mother had a surprise for me.
她给我买了那件外套She had bought me the jacket.
虽然她不知道如何表达Even though she didn't know how to say it,
我知道这意味着她爱我I knew this meant that she loved me.
这才是有关我妈的好故事Now, that's a good story about my mother.
这不是真的 但是个好故事 不是吗It's not true, but it's a good story, right?
{\an\bord\fs\b}美国情景喜剧
我从小时候看过的一集《穆德》里抄来的I stole it from an episode of Maude I saw when I was a kid,
戏里主角在说她爸爸的故事where she talks about her father.
我还记得我看到这一幕时就想 这才是I remember when I saw it, thinking that's the kind of story
那种我想在父母葬礼上讲述的故事I want to tell about my parents when they die.
但我没有这样的故事可讲But I don't have any stories like that.
所有让我成为一个好人的事All I know about being good
都是从电视上学来的I learned from TV.
而在电视上 有缺陷的角色And in TV, flawed characters
总是用这种惊人的善举are constantly showing people they care
来告诉别人自己在乎他们with these surprising grand gestures.
而我觉得我内心中仍然相信这就是爱的真义And I think that part of me still believes that's what love is.
但在现实生活中 善举远远不够But in real life, the big gesture isn't enough.
你得从始至终的好 无可置疑的好You need to be consistent, you need to be dependably good.
你不能搞砸了所有事You can't just screw everything up,
再驾着一条小船出海and then take a boat out into the ocean
去救你的挚友to save your best friend,
或是解开一桩谜案 就飞往堪萨斯or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.
你必须时时刻刻都当个好人 这真是太难了You need to do it every day, which is so... hard.
小时候 你会对自己说When you're a kid, you convince yourself
或许给你点善举也就够了that maybe the grand gesture could be enough.
虽然你的父母不是你所希望的样子That even though your parents aren't what you need them to be,
一次又一次辜负你over and over and over again,
但偶尔 他们可能也会给你惊喜at any moment they might surprise you,
让你体会美好的瞬间with something... wonderful.
我一直在等待这一刻 等某一刻I kept waiting for that, the proof
来证明 虽然我妈是个铁石心肠的女人that even though my mother was a hard woman,
但在内心深处 她是爱我 关心我的deep down, she loved me and cared about me
并且她想让我知道and wanted me to know
我给她的生活带来了一丝光亮that I made her life a little bit brighter.
就算是现在 我发现我还是在等Even now, I find myself waiting.
妈 如果你爱我 关心我 想告诉我Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me and care about me,
我给你的生活带来了一丝光亮 就敲一下and want me to know I made your life a little bit brighter.
我妈没有"温顺地走进那良宵"My mother did not go gentle into that good night.
她死前奋力挣扎 抓挠蹬踹She went clawing and fighting and thrashing,
所以才一副惨相hence the face.
如果你见过她的死相If you'd seen her,
我对天发誓 现在你们唯一会想的I swear to God the only thing you'd be thinking about right now
就是我的形容真是贴切之至is that I am nailing this impression.
在生命的最后时日 我在医院里陪她I was in the hospital with her those last moments,
那段时间真是让人毛骨悚然and they were truly horrifying,
充满了荒谬的尖叫和呐喊full of nonsensical screams and cries,
但有那么一刻 很奇怪 她平静了好一会but there was this moment, this one instant of strange calm,
她望向我所在的方向说 "我看到你了"where she looked in my direction and said, "I see you."
这是她对我说的最后一句话That's the last thing she said to me.
"我看到你了" "I see you."
不是什么批判或者不满Not a statement of judgment or disappointment,
只是简单地接受和承认 just acceptance and the simple recognition
屋子里有另一个人of another person in a room.
"你好 你是个人 我看到你了""Hello, there. You are a person. And I see you."
我告诉你们Let me tell you,
岁时才感到这辈子第一次it's a weird thing to feel at years old,
你妈终于正视你了 这真的很奇怪that for the first time in your life your mother sees you.
奇怪的是你意识到原来这就是你一直所缺少的It's an odd realization that it's the thing you've been missing,
一直以来你想要只是被看见the only thing you wanted all along, to be seen.
而最后你被看见了 并没有感觉解脱And it doesn't feel like a relief, to finally be seen.
而是感觉很糟糕It feels mean, like,
"原来你早就知道我想要什么"Oh, it turns out that you knew what I wanted,
而你却等到最后一刻才给我"and you waited until the very last moment to give it to me."
我本已准备好接受更残忍的事实I was prepared for more cruelty.
我原想着她一定会最后数落我一番I was sure that she would get in one final zinger,
说我如何让她失望 我又肥又蠢about how I let her down, and about how I was fat and stupid,
个子太高跳不了林迪舞and too tall to be an effective Lindyhopper.
我太粘人 是个负担 让她难堪How I was needy and a burden and an embarrassment.
我本准备好任她奚落All that I was ready for.
我没准备好听她说"我看见你了"I was not ready for "I see you."
只有我妈会这么差劲 在临死前Only my mother would be lousy enough to swipe me
用一瞬的温情来摧毁我with a moment of connection on her way out.
或许是我把她说得太好了But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.
或许这和温情无关Maybe it wasn't about connection.
或许这只是 或许这句"我看见你了"Maybe it was a... Maybe it was an "I see you,"
是说"被我发现了"Like, "I see you."
就像是"或许你能骗得了全世界Like, "You might have the rest of the world fooled,
但我很清楚你是什么样的人"but I know exactly who you are."
这才是我妈的作风That's more my mom's speed.
又或许她的意思就是"我看见你了Or maybe she just literally meant "I see you.
你是一个进入了我的视野的东西"You are an object that has entered my field of vision."
她最后已经神志不清了 所以或许She was out of it at the end, so maybe it's dumb
不该试图解读她的意图to try to attribute it to anything.
回想九十年代Back in the s,
我参演了一部非常火的电视剧《胡闹的小马》I was in a very famous TV Show called Horsin' Around.
请不要鼓掌Please hold your applause.
我记得有一次 一个粉丝问我And I remember one time, a fan asked me,
"你记得有一集"Hey, um, you know that episode
伊桑发现他暗恋的人邀请他跳舞where the horse has to give Ethan a pep talk,
只是因为她和朋友在进行很蠢的约会比赛after Ethan finds out his crush only asked him to the dance
所以小马不得不鼓励伊桑吗because her friends were having a dorkiest date contest?
小马所有的镜头中In all the shots of the horse,
你都能在厨房的柜台上看见一个纸咖啡杯you can see a paper coffee cup on the kitchen counter,
但是在伊桑的镜头中 咖啡杯不见了but in the shots of Ethan, the coffee cup's missing.
那是不是因为那部剧想表达一种观点Was that because the show was making a statement,
主观记忆是波动的about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory
以及两个人对同一时刻居然可以and how even two people can experience the same moment
有两种完全不同的感受in entirely different ways?
我不忍心说出口And I didn't have the heart to be, like,
"不是的 "No, man,
那是某个工作人员把自己的咖啡杯落在片场了"some crew guy just left their coffee cup in the shot."
所以我说"是吧"So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."
或许这就像那个咖啡杯And maybe this is like that coffee cup.
或许试图给每件小事Maybe, we're dumb to try
都冠以一个冠冕堂皇的意义很愚蠢to pin significance onto every little thing.
或许当有人说Maybe, when someone says,
"我看见你了" 只是"看见你了"的意思"I see you," it just means, "I see you."
再说了 很有可能她都不是在跟我说话Then again, it's possible she wasn't even talking to me.
因为 老实说 那时她并没有看着我Because, if I'm being honest, she wasn't really looking at me,
她在看着我身后的某处 房间里没有别人了she was looking past me. There was nobody else in the room.
我觉得她在跟我说话 但其实I think she was talking to me, but, honestly,
她那时已经进入弥留之际 谁知道她看什么she was so far gone at that point, who knows what she was seeing.
你在跟谁说话 妈Who were you talking to, Mom?
不说话吗 继续保持沉默[妈]Not saying, huh? Staying mum?
此处没有击鼓吗No rimshot there?
天 不管我付了你多少钱 都太多了God, whatever I'm paying you, it's too much.
或许 她看见了我爸Maybe, she saw my dad.
我爸大约十年前过的世My dad died about ten years ago
因为他在决斗中受了伤of injuries he sustained during a duel.
当你的父亲过世时 你会问自己很多问题When your father dies, you ask yourself a lot of questions.
比如 "等下 你是说他死于决斗"Questions like, "Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"
"谁会死于决斗"and "Who dies in a duel?"
整件事都太蠢了The whole thing was so stupid.
我爸一生都在写书Dad spent his entire life writing this book,
但没有一家店卖这本书but he couldn't get any stores to carry it,
也没有一张报纸评价了这本书or any newspapers to review it.
终于有了一家报社Finally, I guess this one
我猜他们是觉得他很搞笑newspaper thought he was pretty hilarious,
因为他们写了一篇评论 彻底打垮了他because they ran a review and tore him to shreds.
所以 我的父亲 曾经的骄傲玛丽So, my father, ever the Proud Mary,
决定再也不能忍受对他名誉的如此诋毁decided he would not stand for this besmirchment of his honor.
他声称这名评论家He claimed the critic
不明白作为男人的意义didn't understand what it meant to be a man,
所以他要求在凌晨手枪决斗来解决so he demanded satisfaction in the form of pistols at dawn.
他给这家报社写下了一封信He wrote the paper, this letter,
说任何不喜欢他的书的人saying anyone who didn't like his book,
他要与其决斗 所有人he would challenge to a duel, anyone in the world.
他甚至愿意支付He'd even pay for airfare
来旧金山的机票和酒店住宿一晚的费用to San Francisco and a night in a hotel.
最后这愿望在一些蒙大拿的疯子身上实现了Well, eventually this found its way to some kook in Montana,
这些人和他一样疯 接受了他的决斗之请who was as batshit as he was and took him up on the offer.
他们在金门公园碰面并达成一致 They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed:
数到十然后开枪ten paces, then shoot.
但在数数的过程中But in the middle of the ten paces,
爸爸转过身问那个人Dad turned to ask the guy if
他有没有真的看过这本书和他的观点he'd actually read the book and what he thought,
但他没看路but, not looking where he was going,
被一根暴露在外的树根绊倒 头撞上了一块石头tripped over an exposed root and bashed his head on a rock.
真希望我那时知道去玩偶匣I wish I'd known to go to Jack in the Box then.
也许能得到一根免费油条Maybe I could have gotten a free churro.
也算是作为巴特斯科齐·马男的儿子It would've been nice to have something to show
能拿出来吹嘘的事迹了for being the son of Butterscotch Horseman.
我亲爱的母亲发表了悼词My darling mother gave the eulogy.
我这辈子都没听她说过My entire life I never heard
我父亲半点好话her say a kind word to or about my father,
但在葬礼上她说but at his funeral she said,
"我的丈夫去世了 现在所有事都更糟了""My husband is dead, and everything is worse now."
"我的丈夫去世了 现在所有事都更糟了""My husband is dead, and everything is worse now."
我不知道她为什么这么说I don't know why she said that.
或许她觉得葬礼上Maybe she felt that's the kind of thing
应该这么说you're supposed to say at a funeral.
或许她希望某天有人也会这样评价她Maybe she hoped one day someone would say that about her.
"我母亲去世了 现在所有事都更糟了""My mother is dead, and everything is worse now."
又或许她已经知道了他把所有Or maybe she knew that he had frittered away
她的遗产都挥霍光了 只留给她沉重的债务all her inheritance, and replaced it with crippling debt,
给自己的遗孀留下这些真的是很渣which is a pretty shitty thing to leave your widow with.
"坏消息 你失去了丈夫"Bad news, you lost a husband,
不过别担心 你的房子也没了"but don't worry, you also lost the house!"
或许妈妈已经知道她得变卖所有高级珠宝Maybe Mom knew she'd have to sell all her fancy jewelry
搬到一个普通房子中去and move into a home.
或许她说"所有事都更糟了"是这个意思Maybe that's what she meant by "Everything is worse."
你是这个意思吗 妈Is that what you meant, Mom?
不得不说 我这双簧唱得真是太棒了I gotta say, I'm really carrying this double act.
{\an\bord\fs\b}美国超红魔术节目主持人
至少佩恩与特勒这一对At least with Penn and Teller,
不说话的那个还要变纸牌魔术the quiet one does card tricks.
弹琴的 我跟我妈讲笑话时Hey, piano man, when I say something funny to my mom,
你给我来两声鼓点怎么样how about you give me one of those rimshot?
对 但现在别敲Yeah, but not now.
等我讲笑话时再敲 比如When I say something funny. Like, okay.
我妈和细菌的破坏性驱What's the difference between my mother
有什么区别and a disruptive expulsion of germs?
一个引起咳嗽 一个躺进棺材[音似]One's a coughin' fit and the other fits a coffin!
这样才叫讲笑话That's an example of a funny thing.
谢谢 咱们再试一次Thank you. Let's try again.
妈 我妈和一堆Hey, Mom. What's the difference
复活节彩蛋有什么区别between my mother and a bunch of Easter eggs?
一个装进小篮子 另一个埋进小匣子One gets carried in a basket, the other gets buried in a casket!
还想再听一个吗 最后一个Ready for one more? Last one.
文学院一年级生和我妈马男碧翠斯What's the difference between a firstyear lit major
有什么区别呢and my mother, Beatrice Horseman?
一个饱读诗书 另一个就是个贱人大混蛋One is decently read, and the other's a huge bitch!
这个笑话可能开的有点过了Might have gone a little too far with that one.
对在座各位来说That one might have been a
说"我妈是个贱人大混蛋"有点过分了little too "My mom's a huge bitch" for the room.
抱歉 妈妈 你不是个大混蛋I'm sorry, Mother. You're not a huge bitch.
你生前是个贱人大混蛋 现在你死了You were a huge bitch... and now you're dead.
跟你们说 我第一次You know, the first time
在观众面前进行表演I ever performed in front of an audience,
其实是和我妈一起的it actually was, uh, with my mom.
她从前总会进行演出She used to put on these shows,
就在她在客厅举办的晚餐舞会上with her supper club in the living room,
她会让我...and she used to make...
她会让我唱《棒棒糖之歌》She used to make me sing "The Lollipop Song."
那些派对真是豪华Those parties, they were really something.
会演滑稽短剧 有魔术表演There were skits and magic acts,
还有不涉种族问题的歌舞杂耍and ethnically insensitive vaudeville routines,
而最后总是以我妈的一舞收尾and the big finale was always a dance my mother did.
她有一条漂亮的裙子She had this beautiful dress
她只在这些派对上穿出来that she only brought out for these parties,
她跳过很多次and she did this incredible number.
这真是又漂亮又悲哀It was so beautiful and sad.
爸爸讨厌派对 他会把自己所在书房Dad hated the parties. He'd lock himself in the study,
邦邦锤墙好让我们小点声and bang on the walls for us to keep it down,
但他总会出来看妈妈跳舞but he always came out to see Mom dance.
他会站在门口 手握苏格兰威士忌He'd linger in the doorway, scotch in hand,
用惊讶的目光看着他娶的这个and watch in awe, as this cynical,
愤世嫉俗 卑劣不堪的女人翩然起舞despicable woman he married... took flight.
作为一个被我爸妈吓坏了的小孩And as a child who was completely terrified of both my parents,
这一刻在我心中的感觉却是那么美好I was always aware that this moment of grace,
此中定有深意it meant something.
某种程度上 我们是互相理解的We understood each other, in a way.
我和我妈还有我爸 我们虽然都悲惨不堪Me and my mom and my dad, as screwed up as we all were,
但确实都相互理解we did understand each other.
我妈妈非常明白她的整个人生仿佛就像My mother, she knew what it's like to feel your entire life
水慢慢没过头顶般溺水 但这些时刻是例外like you're drowning with the exception of these moments,
这些非常稀少 短暂的瞬间these very rare, brief instances,
此时你突然记起 你是会游泳的in which you suddenly remember... you can swim.
但是我再次强调 大多数时候不是But, then again, mostly not.
大多数时候都是溺水状态Mostly you're drowning.
她也明白这点She understood that too.
她也知道我和爸爸也明白这点And she recognized that I understood it. And Dad.
我们三人都淹在水里All three of us were drowning,
我们不知道如何拯救对方and we didn't know how to save each other,
但我们都明白but there was an understanding
我们要一起溺水而亡that we were all drowning together.
在医院里她说"我看到你了"时I would like to think that's what she meant
我想这就是她想表达的意思when we were in the hospital and she said, "I see you."
奇怪的是 当你父母皆亡时The weird thing about both your parents being dead
这意味着下一个死的就是你了is it means that you're next.
我是说I mean, you know,
当然并不是说死亡还有排队叫号的obviously it's not like there's a wait list for dying.
任何时候 我们谁都有可能Any one of us could get run over
让一个正自拍的青少年开车撞死by a Snapchatting teen at any moment.
你们以为明了这一点And you would think that
会让自己显得更具冒险精神knowing that would make us more adventurous,
更加和善宽容and kind, and forgiving.
但这让我们变得渺小愚蠢 微不足道But it makes us small, and stupid, and petty.
其实我最近就有一次濒死经历I actually had a neardeath experience, recently.
做特技失败了 我摔下了楼顶A stunt went bad and I fell off a building.
我是个演员 亲自上阵演特效I'm an actor. I do my own stunts.
我出演新剧《菲尔伯特》 I'm on this new show Philbert.
我演菲尔伯特 本剧主演I'm Philbert. Star of the show.
剧还没播出 但艾美奖已经频频来电了It hasn't come out yet, but it's already getting Emmy buzz.
说到这个Oh, speaking of buzz...
我应该每天早晨吃两片这药I'm supposed to take two of these every morning,
但我的日子因为拍摄日程搞得一团糟but my days are so screwed up 'cause of the shooting schedule,
我连早晨是什么意思都不知道了I don't even know what morning means anymore.
我这段话里埋了个笑话的There's a joke in there somewhere,
说的是一个人出席了太多次葬礼about a guy who's been to so many funerals,
{\an\bord\fs\b}早晨和哀悼音似
最后连哀悼是什么意思都不知道了he doesn't even know what mourning means anymore.
你们自己想笑点在哪儿吧Let you guys figure that one out for yourselves.
总之 你们知道我摔下大楼Anyway, you know what I thought...
进入恐慌模式时 我是怎么想的吗when I was falling off the building and I went into panic mode?
我愚蠢的大脑The last thing that my
在死前想到的最后一件事是什么stupid brain could come up with before I died?
他们不会难过吗"Won't they be sorry."
想得漂亮 大脑Cool thought, brain.
不 这个不是...No, that wasn't...
你能不能...重来好吗Would you just... Dial it back, all right?
我都不知道我希望会难过的"他们"都是谁I don't even know what "They" I wanted to be sorry.
我妈在死之前几乎都记不得我是谁My mom, even before she died, could barely remember who I was.
而且当然 我爸已经死了And of course, my dad's dead.
我和他最后一次说话谈的是他的小说The last conversation I ever had with him was about his novel.
他当时那么坚信 这本书会成就他的传奇He was so certain this book was his legacy.
或许他以为这本书能证明Maybe he thought it would vindicate him
他在这毫无价值的愚蠢一生里for all the shitty things
做过的所有破事都是对的he ever did in his stupid worthless life.
或许是吧 我也不知道 我从没读过Maybe it did. I don't know. I never read it.
我为什么要让他如愿呢Because why would I give him that?
我曾出演过一部叫《胡闹的小马》的剧I used to be on this TV show called Horsin' Around.
说真的 先忍着别鼓掌Seriously, hold your applause.
忍得真好Well held.
剧本是我朋友赫比·哈萨克写的 他也死了It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz, who's also dead now,
剧中女主的扮演者名叫萨拉·琳and it starred this little girl named Sarah Lynn.
电视剧讲的是孤儿的事And it was about these orphans.
一开始时 网上有条建议And early on, the network had a note,
"或许别总提起他们是孤儿的事"Maybe don't mention they're orphans so much,
因为观众会觉得孤儿很可怜 没有共鸣"because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not relatable."
但我从来没觉得那些孤儿很可怜I never thought the orphans were sad.
我一直觉得他们很幸运I always thought they were lucky
因为他们可以随意想象because they could imagine
自己的父母是自己想要的样子their parents to be anything they wanted.
他们有期盼They had something to long for.
不管怎么样 我们拍一集季终集时Anyway, we did this one season finale,
是讲奥利维亚的生母回到镇上where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.
她是个瘾君子 但是戒干净了And she was a junkie, but she's gotten herself cleaned up,
她想重新回到奥利维亚的身边and she wants to be in Olivia's life again.
当然了 她就像奥利维亚长大后的完美复刻And of course, she's like a perfect grownup version of Olivia,
她们一起去商场and they go to the mall together
一起打耳洞 就像她一直想要的那样and get her ears pierced, like she's always wanted and
抱歉 如果你还在奇怪我说的是什么剧Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six finale of Horsin' Around,
《快乐的小马》第六季季终剧透预警if you're still working your way through it.
然后小马想提醒她 "小心点Anyway, the horse tries to warn her, "Be careful,
妈妈总会让你失望"moms have a way of letting you down."
但是奥利维亚认为小马只是在嫉妒But Olivia just thinks the horse is jealous,
然后当妈妈说她要搬到加州去后and when the mom says she's moving to California,
奥利维亚决定和她一起走Olivia decides to go with her.
然后电视台简直给大家吊足了胃口And the network really juiced the cliffhanger:
"奥利维亚永远离开了吗"''Is Olivia gone for good?''
但当然了 这是电视剧 她不会永远离开But of course, because it's a TV show, she was not gone for good.
当然了 这是电视剧Of course, because it's a TV show,
奥利维亚的妈妈复吸 回到了戒毒所Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab,
于是奥利维亚只能一路搭车回家so Olivia had to hitchhike all the way home,
一路遇见了T先生 埃尔夫和斯坦普的人getting rides from Mr. T, Alf, and the cast of Stomp.
当然会这样了Of course that's what happened.
因为你还能怎么办 把奥利维亚砍掉吗Because, what are you gonna do, just not have Olivia on the show?
情景喜剧不会有圆满大结局 不会的You can't have happy endings in sitcoms, not really,
因为如果大家都很开心 那剧就结束了because, if everyone's happy, the show would be over,
不管怎么样 剧...得继续拍and above all else, the show... has to keep going.
永远有更多集There's always more show.
你可以说《快乐的小马》蠢 烂或者不现实And you can call Horsin' Around dumb, or bad, or unrealistic,
但这才是最现实的情况but there is nothing more realistic than that.
你不会看到圆满结局 因为永远有更多集You never get a happy ending, 'cause there's always more show.
可能直到最终没有了吧I guess until there isn't.
我妈妈要是知道我在她的葬礼上My mom would hate it if she knew

肯定会气死的talking about my old TV show.
也可能她会觉得她唯一的儿子连这都做不好Or maybe she'd think it was funny that her idiot son
简直是太可笑了 谁知道呢couldn't even do this right. Who knows?
她没知会过我她希望我说些什么She left no instructions for what she wanted me to say.
我只知道她想要开棺All I know is she wanted an open casket,
她的蠢儿子连这都办不好and her idiot son couldn't even do that right.
我不会站在这里假装I'm not gonna stand up here and pretend
我知道该怎么取悦这女人I even understood how to please that woman,
即便我人生中的很多时间even though so much of my life
都浪费在对此的思考之上has been wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.
但我一直回想起在重症监护室里But I keep going back to that moment in the ICU
她看着我 然后说when she looked at me, and...
"ICU"[缩写 音同我看到你了]"Icu."
"我看到你了""I... see... you."
上帝啊 我们当时在重症监护室Jesus Christ, we were in the intensive care unit.
她只是在念指示牌She was just reading a sign.
我妈妈死了 而我只有这根免费的油条My mom died and all I got was this free churro.
你们知道最糟心的是什么吗You know the shittiest thing about all of this?
当柜台后的那个陌生人给我免费油条时Is when that stranger behind the counter gave me that free churro,
这小小的善意之举中所流露出的同情that small act of kindness showed more compassion
比我妈妈这辈子给予我的都要多than my mother gave me her entire goddamn life.
好好对一个人能有多难Like, how hard is it to do something nice for a person?
玩偶匣的那个女人甚至都不认识我This woman at the Jack in the Box didn't even know me.
我是你的儿子啊I'm your son.
我只有你啊All I had was you!
我有一个朋友I have this friend.
我初见她时And right around when I first met her,
她父亲死了 我陪她去了葬礼her dad died, and I actually went with her to the funeral.
几个月后 她告诉我她不明白为什么自己And months later, she told me that she didn't understand
还是很难过 因为她从来就不喜欢她父亲why she was still upset, because she never even liked her father.
我觉得很合理It made sense to me,
因为我父亲死后我也经历过这样的阶段because I went through the same thing when my dad died.
现在我又在经历这样的事And I'm going through the same thing now.
你知道这是种怎样的感觉吗You know what it's like?
就像那部《贝克》 泰德·丹森演的It's like that show Becker, you know, with Ted Danson?
我整部剧都看了下来I watched the entire run of that show,
希望剧情能变好 但却一直没有hoping that it would get better, and it never did.
明明拥有各种天时地利It had all the right pieces,
但就是...就是没办法结合起来but it just It couldn't put them together.
这部剧被砍后And when it got canceled,
我真的很难过 不是因为我喜欢那部剧I was really bummed out, not because I liked the show,
而是因为我知道明明能拍得更好but because I knew it could be so much better,
而现在没有机会了and now it never would be.
这就是失去父母时的感觉And that's what losing a parent is like.
就像《贝克》It's like Becker.
突然间 你意识到Suddenly, you realize
你再也不会拥有你想要的和谐关系了you'll never have the good relationship you wanted,
本来只要他们还活着 就算你从来不会承认and as long as they were alive, even though you'd never admit it,
你内心中总有那么愚蠢的一部分part of you, the stupidest goddamn part of you,
依然抱着这种奢望was still holding on to that chance.
等到这种奢望彻底化为乌有 你才意识到And you didn't even realize it until that chance went away.
“我妈妈去世了 现在所有事都更糟了""My mother is dead, and everything is worse now."
因为现在我知道永远不会再有一个妈妈Because now I know I will never have a mother
从房间那头看着我 说who looks at me from across a room and says,
"马男波杰克 我看到你了""BoJack Horseman, I see you."
但我想知道了也好But I guess it's good to know.
知道没有人会照顾着我也好It's good to know that there is nobody looking out for me,
从来没有过 也永远不会有that there never was, and there never will be.
不 知道我只能No, it's good to know
依靠我自己也好that I am the only one that I can depend on.
我现在知道了 很好 我知道了也好And I know that now and it's good. It's good that I know that.
所以...我妈妈去世了也好So... it's good my mother is dead.
废话多说[打死马]也没用Well. No point beating a dead horse.
马男碧翠斯生于年Beatrice Horseman was born in ,
死于年 我不知道...她想要什么and she died in , and I have no idea... what she wanted.
除非她想要的和我们都一样Unless she just wanted what we all want...
被人看到to be seen.
这里是殡仪馆B馆吗Is this Funeral Parlor B? 

## 第七集 

我错了 我错了 你能来就太好了 I know, I know. I'm just glad you showed up.
服务员们都开始起疑心了The waitstaff was starting to get suspicious.
你们看 我没撒谎 我确实有老婆See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife!
好吧 你就是想让我丢脸All right. You're trying to embarrass me.
没错 现在我好多了And I did. And now I'm fine.
你好呀 你好呀 Hi, you. Hi, you.
办公室不顺利吗Long day at the office?
调解失败了 英迪拉 不是吧 I lost them, Indira. No.
我做企业调解这么多年In all my years of corporate mediation,
从来没有出现过I've never been unable to
纠纷调解失败导致仲裁的情况resolve a dispute before it goes to arbitration.
我是玛丽·贝丝 调解专家I'm MaryBeth, the Mediating Maven.
你肯定帮了他们很多 只是你不知道I'm sure you helped them in ways you'll never even know.
我 你别给我做心理咨询 但你很好开导 I Don't therapize me. But you're so easy!
这样显得我好像真的很擅长You make me feel like I'm actually good at it.
你最近怎么样What's going on with you?
这周不太顺利 跟我说说 It's been a tough week. Tell me.
我不应该聊客户的事 说嘛 I shouldn't talk about my clients. Come on.
你可以给他们换个名字What if you changed all the names
换一些体貌特征and identifying characteristics?
好 故事的主人公是...Okay. This is a story about...
波...波...是波波 一匹焦虑的斑马Bo... Bo... BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.
{\an\bord\fs\b}《焦虑的斑马波波》第五季第七集
一切都起源于周一So, it all started on Monday.
我当时正在跟戴安...I was in a session with Diane
娜 戴安娜...a! Diana.
你是说鲸鱼公主戴安娜吗Like Diana, Princess of Whales?
没错Exactly.
当鲸鱼公主真是太难了It's just so tough being Princess of Whales.
我无法满足所有鲸鱼的所有需求Like, I can't be all things to all whales.
你在逃避问题 我没有 You're deflecting. I'm not deflecting!
聊一聊波波录音的事吧Let's talk about the BoBo tape.
波波录音是什么What's the BoBo tape?
她最近拿到了一段录音带She recently came into possession of an audiotape
声音的主人是她朋友兼同事 焦虑斑马波波of her friend and coworker, BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.
在船上 有个女孩 在新墨西哥On the boat. There was a girl. In New Mexico.
她信任我 另外 我是一匹斑马And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.
他说的是哪个女孩 我不知道 What girl is he talking about? I don't know.
女孩听起来就很年轻"Girl" sounds young, right?
不管是什么事 肯定很糟糕Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,
不然的话 他为什么不告诉我because, otherwise, why wouldn't he tell me?
戴安娜 别人的问题Diana, you are not responsible
不是你的责任for the dysfunction of others.
我的书就是这个主题I actually explore this in my book,
《别人的问题是你的责任吗》Are You Responsible For The Dysfunction of Others?
{\an\bord\fs\b}《别人的问题是你的责任吗》
以下有剧透 不是Spoiler alert: You're not!
{\an\bord\fs\b}答案是 不是
我很希望能跟他聊聊I just wish I could talk to him about it,
但他现在状态不佳but he's like an open sore.
大家请注意 也许有些人已经听说Attention! As some of you might have heard,
我妈妈最近去世了my mom died recently.
我知道你们都很担心I know you're very concerned,
但我希望大家知道 这不会影响我的工作but I wanna let you know it will not affect my work.
我在这里 我很好I'm here, and I'm doing fine.
我会集中精力拍戏I just want to focus on the show.
请大家一切照常So, please treat this like any other day,
对我稍微好一点and be extranice to me
因为我是著名演员 不是因为我妈去世了because I am a famous actor, not because my mom died.
谢谢 很好Thank you. Good.
没错 这就是我要的效果Yes, that's what I'm looking for.
大家去忙自己的吧Just go about your business.
这样很好 因为我不想聊我妈的事That's good 'cause I don't want to talk about my mom.
你听说我妈去世了吗Hey. Did you hear my mom died?
听说了 但你不想聊这件事Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.
对 不过她死了还挺奇怪的吧No. Pretty weird she died, though, huh?
你想聊聊吗 不 我只是觉得挺奇怪的 Do you want to talk about it? No. I'm just saying it's weird.
波波 我很遗憾 我很不想聊这件事 BoBo. I am so sorry. And I so don't wanna talk about it.
你对我妈有执念吗 你这人真是有问题Obsessed with my mom much? You're the one with issues.
我觉得他希望我安慰他 但我在生他的气I feel like he wants me to comfort him, but I'm still angry.
也许你们需要给彼此一点空间Maybe you could both use some space from each other.
不如你跟他说 你需要专心工作Why don't you tell him you need to focus on your work?
什么工作 弗利皮什么都不让我做What work? Flippy won't let me do anything.
{\an\bord\fs\b}弗利皮
弗利皮 你还好吗Flippy? Are you okay?
{\an\bord\fs\b}我当然不好
{\an\bord\fs\b}我很烦跳圈圈 还要把球顶在空中[海豚杂技]
今天我们拍什么Hey, what are we filming today?
为什么有潜水艇布景Why is there a submarine set?
{\an\bord\fs\b}这是我刚写的
{\an\bord\fs\b}室内戏 潜艇
室内戏 潜艇Interior sub?
{\an\bord\fs\b}本来想写的是"室内戏 地铁"
那你怎么没写完呢Why didn't you just write "Way"?
{\an\bord\fs\b}我还没写到那里 写作需要时间
好吧 那我们现在就想一个Okay. So, now we just need to come up with a scene
在潜艇里发生的镜头that takes place in a submarine.
{\an\bord\fs\b}我本想写的 然后你来了
{\an\bord\fs\b}赶紧走 我要工作
好吧Okay.
{\an\bord\fs\b}弗利皮
你听说我妈去世了吗Did you hear my mom died?
这样吧 如果他想聊How about this? If he wants to talk,
但你还没准备好安慰他 你就跟他说and you don't feel ready to confront him,
你的心理咨询师说你需要空间tell him your therapist says you need space.
这就是我犯的错误 我按我的思路来了That's where I went wrong. I inserted myself into her story.
别难为自己 记得詹内特医生说的话吗Don't beat yourself up. Remember what Doctor Janet said?
{\an\bord\fs\b}别难为自己
跟我讲讲你今天的事吧Tell me about your day.
工作纠纷调解出问题了吗You had a tough workplace mediation?

他们还住在一起They also live together.
{\an\bord\fs\b}《年轻火辣的渴望》
多么美好的早晨啊What a beautiful morning!
等等 等等 让我想想Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.
如果你的故事里能有戴安娜王妃If your story can have Princess Diana,
为什么我的故事里不能有个手指脸大帝why can't mine have Emperor FingerFace?
她不是真的戴安娜王妃 只是叫戴安娜It's not actually Princess Diana. She's just named Diana.
可我脑补的就是王妃的形象I've been picturing Princess Diana.
好吧Okay, fine.
告诉我手指脸大帝发生了什么Tell me what happened with Emperor FingerFace.
他和一个叫He lived in the same apartment
渴望激情的迷乱之雾的女人as a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning
住在同一间公寓里in the shape of a woman.

我没时间去厨房了I don't have time to go to the kitchen.
直接热线发动我的车吧I'll just hotwire my car.
你吃早饭了吗 没时间吃了 Hey, did you eat breakfast? No time for meals.
我就是不定时的有啥吃啥I just grab whatever I can, whenever I can.
等等Hold on.
我知道你很忙I know you're a gal on the go,
就算是团渴望激情的迷乱之雾but even tangled fogs of pulsating yearning
也要好好吃饭need to eat right.
我会在片场随便吃点I'll get something on set.
拉钩吗 我戳到脸了Pinky swear? Ow! I poked my face!
我感觉有点跟不上你的故事I feel I'm having a hard time following the story
你的角色人设好奇怪because of how weird you made the characters.
重要的是这两人已经同居一年了The important thing is that these two have been living together
但几乎就没吵过架for almost a year with virtually no drama.
从某种程度上讲 这是他俩经历过的In some ways, it's the most functional relationship
最成功的感情了either have ever been in!
好吧 这么看也没那么奇怪了Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.
很好 那我接着讲迷雾女和脸帝的事了Great! Now, back to the story of the fog and the hand!
说吧 我能为你做什么So. What can I do you for?
我在片场没有办公的地方I have no workspace on set.

是的 我正握着我的笔 准备把它Yep, I am currently gripping my pen inside my jacket.
从外套里拿出来 然后签字Now to just pull it out and sign this document.
这充分证明了Just goes to show,
只要牵对线 就可以得到自己想要的you get what you need if you pull the right strings.
线Strings?
是你 什么是我 It was you! What was me?
家里最后一根奶酪棒The last string cheese in the apartment,
我特意留着的 是你吃了它I was saving it. And you took it!
现在你还想让我给批间办公室And now you want me to give you an office?
什么 我没动你的奶酪What?! I didn't take your cheese.
我们是不是产生了工作纠纷Uhoh, are we having a workrelated conflict?
好像更像是This feels like more of a
你在我家当沙发客相关的住宿纠纷youcrashingonmycouchrelated conflict.
我入职的时候签的合同上说When I started here, I signed a contract that said,
任何办公室内部的纠纷都要通过调解解决all intraoffice disputes must be resolved via mediation,
如果调解失败 就必须进行仲裁or failing that, forced arbitration.
然后我 你怎么都不吃So, then I... You're not eating.
我只是 一直在想斑马波波I just...I keep thinking about BoBo the Zebra.
好吧 波波后来怎么样了Okay, what happened next with BoBo?
他想回去工作Well, he wanted to get back to work,
但弗利皮文思枯竭了but since Flippy had writer's block,
演员也就没戏可演了there was nothing for the actors to do.
为什么没得拍了How is there nothing to shoot?
所以我就得这么干等着So, what, I just have to wait around,
独自消化我的思绪吗 真是恶心and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.
我在拍《杀手终结者》时When I was on The MurderStoppers.
有一次我们不得不终止拍摄We had to shut down production
因为尼克·诺特不肯从他的拖车里出来because Nick Nolte wouldn't come out of his trailer.
{\an\bord\fs\b}美国演员 监制
他根本都没出演 一直在拖车里待着He wasn't even on the show! He was in one of our trailers,
死也不出来and we couldn't get him out!
写个剧本能有多难 吉诺How hard is it to write a script, Gino?
我是菲尔伯特 砰砰 是个硬汉"Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang. I'm a tough guy.
我老婆死了 是我杀的吗My wife is dead! Did I kill her?
谁知道呢 我很酷[没意见]Who knows? I'm cool."
这段挺好的 我们不能就这么拍吗That was pretty good. Can we just roll on that?
有戏拍的时候自然就会拍了When there's something to shoot, we'll shoot.
说到这 你想不想在Meanwhile, you wanna go bang
你的拖车里来一发 我去戴我的子宫帽one out in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.
不了 我会一直想着我死去的妈妈Nah, I'd just be thinking about my dead mom the whole time,
可能会破坏气氛 或者which would either ruin it or...
老天 如果更爽怎么办 我不想知道Oh, God, what if it makes it better? I don't wanna know that.

失去至亲一定很难过It must be so hard to lose a loved one.
我就没经历过I, for one, never have.
你从没失去过至亲吗You've never lost a loved one?
我妈妈老了后就搬去了一个农场 什么 When my mom got old, she moved to a farm. What?
在乡下 这样她就有足够的空间跑来跑去On the country, where she could have plenty of room to run free.
都老了干吗还要跑来跑去Why would she wanna run around if she's old?
我从来没有质疑过这之中的逻辑You know, I never really questioned the logic.
都是我哥一手安排的 我从没去过那My brother set the whole thing up. I haven't been able to visit,
不过家里人老了之后都会搬过去but everyone in my family goes to that farm eventually.
老兄 你妈已经死了Oh, dude, your mom's dead.

她为什么要这么说 Why would she say that?
不知道 我只是她的病人Don't know. I'm just the client.
是她是我意思 不是我的 我该走了Her call, not mine. I should go.
大伙听我说 我亲爱的妈妈已经仙逝了Everybody? My dear mother has transcended this plane.
我现在超级脆弱I am incredibly fragile
需要尽可能多的支持and could use all the support I can get,
所以如果大家都能对我多多关心so if everyone could pay a lot of attention to me,
问我很多关于我母亲的问题and ask me a lot of questions about my mother,
或许跟我讲讲自己母亲的故事and maybe tell me stories about your mothers,
我真的觉得那会让我好很多I think that would really make me feel a lot better.

我准备将它融化I was gonna melt it down
然后雕刻成一个马苏里拉奶酪灰姑娘and then sculpt it into a Mozzarella Cinderella!
但我回到家时 我的奶酪棒不见了But when I got home, my string cheese was gone!
不能意味着就是我拿了Doesn't mean I took it.

我们都知道你打开了冰箱We know you opened the fridge.
你还把我的钥匙放在里面You put my keys in there.
我害怕的时候吃不下东西I can't eat while I'm terrified.
所以我从不知道咬碎美味可古拉伯爵的感觉That's why I'll never know the delicious crunch of Count Chocula.

所以当杰里·刘易斯把我错当成贴身男仆后So, when Jerry Lewis mistook me for the valet,
他承受了我无法揣测的巨大痛苦he was carrying so much pain I could never fathom.
那次的领悟And that realization
让我学会了原谅 不是为了他 为我自己allows me to forgive. Not for his sake, but for mine.
我说了多久了Wow. How long was I talking?
希望你有发泄出来I hope that was cathartic for you.
明天你想约个时间过来吗You wanna come back same time tomorrow?

你是 我的新闺蜜吗Are you... my new best friend?
抱歉 感觉一直都是我在讲Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hogging all the conversation.
你的故事肯定比我的要多There's definitely more to your story than mine.
我的故事更像是支线 也可以说是备胎故事Mine's more like a secondary story. A Bstory, if you will.
我的故事会越来越严重I have a feeling it will continue to offer a light alternative,
我觉得需要穿插你的故事as my story gets increasingly serious.
我们继续在我们的故事中来回切换吧Let's continue to switch back and forth between our stories,
在最有趣的时刻暂停pausing at their most interesting moments.
感觉这是交谈最为自然的方式That feels like the most natural way to have a conversation.
当我和波波说话时Well, while I was talking to BoBo,
戴安娜在努力维持片场的秩序Diana was trying to keep things together on set.
我以为该我说了I thought it was my turn.
天呐 天呐 好了 停 Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Okay, cut?
{\an\bord\fs\b}好莱乌
为什么萨西要说"天呐"Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?"
我只是觉得 既然大家都在I just figured, we've got all these people here,
我们也能拍点什么we might as well film some stuff.
假设发生了什么可怕的事 如果是的话Presumably something shocking will happen, and then if it does,
我们拍下你说"天呐"的样子we have a shot of you saying, "Oh, my God!"
可以 戴安娜 能借一步说话吗 Makes sense. Diana, can I talk to you for a sec?
我知道你正在经历一些事 需要界限I know you're going through something, and need boundaries,
但我找你不是为了私事 是关于这部剧but this isn't personal, it's about the show.
什么事What is it?
我撒谎了 我要说的百分百是私事I lied. It's a % personal.
什么 但是件好事 你会喜欢的 What? But it's good! You're gonna like this.
记得你说你需要空间吗 记得 Remember you said you needed space? Yes.
你跟我说这句话的时候 我没接受When you told me that, I didn't take it well.
但我交了一个新朋友But I made a new friend,
所以现在一切正常了 那挺好啊 so everything is good now. Oh. Well, that's great.
很高兴你这么觉得 因为 有趣的转折I'm glad you think so because, fun twist,

你想和别人谈谈很好 你也应该和别人谈谈It's great that you would wanna talk to someone, and you should!
但她是我的 我真的需要她只是我的But she's mine. I really need her to just be mine.
你能理解吗 好吧 Can you understand that? Yeah.
戴安娜让我不要和你做朋友Diana asked me not to be friends with you,
所以出于对她的尊重so out of respect for her,
我觉得我最好背着她继续见你I think it's best that I continue seeing you behind her back.
我们还可以在午餐的时候见面We can still do our lunchtime hang outs,
但为了掩盖我们的踪迹but to cover our tracks,
我会在你的病人名册上登记I'll compensate you for your time on the books.
这样就像你有一位新客户一样So it'll seem as if you have a client.
还有安全起见 我们应该And, to be safe, we should
签一份治疗师朋友保密协议invoke a therapisttofriend confidentiality.
怎么样How's that sound?
{\an\bord\fs\b}在一场难以置信的单边对话之后
我在梦里是菲尔伯特 有的时候我醒来So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert, and sometimes when I wake up,
我不知道我是菲尔伯特还是我自己I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me,
或者我还在做梦or if I'm still dreaming.
我们的友谊时间到了Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.
我真的很高兴我能I'm just so glad that I can
用有趣的午餐谈话让你help break up your day of listening to whiny babies
不用一整天都听那些叽叽歪歪的人叽歪with some entertaining lunchtime convo.
我应该告诉他我们是在做治疗吗Should I have told him what we were doing was therapy?
从某种程度来讲 他一定知道是怎么回事On some level, he must have known what was going on.
我不明白的是What I don't understand is,
如果你知道戴安娜让他不要去见你...if you knew Diana asked him not to see you
我是个治疗师 医生治愈人 DJ打碟I'm a therapist. A doctor heals. A DJ spins.

大家好Hello, everyone.
很感谢诸位来参加我作品的首映礼Thank you for attending the premiere of my opus.
希望大家喜欢因为这说明你们很聪明I hope you all enjoy it because that means you are smart.
如果你们没看懂 说明我的天才在我自己的时代If you don't get it, that means that my genius wasn't appreciated
没有得到欣赏 那也没关系in my own time, and that's okay, too.
你们为什么笑 请不要在放映时笑Why are you laughing? Please do not laugh during the screening.
这段不是在搞笑This episode contains no intentional humor.
好吧 你的澄清Okay. That's that's always a good sign,
总是不错的预兆 大伙们 赫比是在谦虚when you have to clarify that. Look, folks, Herb is being modest.
"赫比" 抱歉 "Herb"? I'm sorry.
是弗利普 我说成赫比了吗Flip. Did I say Herb?
赫比是在谦虚 但他导演了一部伟大的剧作Herb is being modest, but he put together a tremendous show
我觉得大家真的会喜欢的that I think that you guys are really gonna love.
对 这全都来自于这个大脑That's right. It all came out of this brain.
他说是那个大脑吗 那个大脑 呵呵 Ha! That brain, he says? That brain? Doubleha!
这部剧最令人惊叹的地方And the most amazing thing about this show
就是我很肯定我们的生活中都有菲尔伯特的身影is that I'm sure we all have Philberts in our lives,
或者我们就是菲尔伯特or we are Philberts.
我们都做过令自己后悔不已的事You know, we've all done terrible things that we deeply regret.
我做过太多 无法原谅的事I've done so many... unforgivable things.
我觉得 这就是这部剧的深意And I think that, that's what this show says.
我们都很糟糕Is that... is that we're all terrible,
所以我们都 挺好so therefore we're all... okay.
什么What?
我觉得这真的是个发人深省的信息And I think that's a really powerful message.
好了 言归正传 第一章Okay, well, without further ado, the first chapter,
注意我说的是"章" 而不是"集"and notice I said "Chapter" not episode
因为我觉得这部剧不是一部菲尔伯特的because I think of this show as more of a novel than a TV show...
电视剧 更像小说of Philbert!
没什么比派对更寂寞的了Nothing's lonelier than a party.
{\an\bord\fs\b}紧凑的小时分钟后

在那间房里 听见大家为菲尔伯特喝彩To be in that room. To hear people cheering for Philbert!
你在说什么 我第一次做这份工作时 What are you talking about? When I first started on this job,
我想让菲尔伯特这个角色更丰满I wanted to make Philbert more wellrounded,
好让观众更容易与他产生共鸣so the audience could relate to him better.
但现在你不高兴And now you're upset
是因为我介绍时没有提到你because I didn't mention you in my introduction.
戴安 电视的所有意义Diane, the whole point of television
就在于它是一个协作媒体is it's a collaborative medium,
所有功劳都归一人 不 不是因为这 where one person gets all the credit. No, it's not about that.
我让他更脆弱 这使得他更受人喜欢I made him more vulnerable, and that made him more likable,
也使得这部剧更成功which makes for a better TV show.
但如果菲尔伯特只是帮助白痴混蛋们But if Philbert is just a way to help dumb assholes rationalize
为自己的恶劣行为找借口的一种方式their own awful behavior,
那对不起 但我们不能播出well, I'm sorry, but we can't put this out there.

导致 这就是分歧 他污蔑了我的技艺Led? That's the whole rift! He besmirched my craft.
我至今都没原谅这个混蛋I still haven't forgiven the son of a bitch!
我当时是这么说的 现在依然这么觉得I said it then, and I stand by it now!
写包袱的压力是最大的All the pressure's on the punch line!

不知道 我只是Oh, I don't know, I was just

并不是《菲尔伯特》的主旨for guys to watch it and feel okay.
戴安 这是称赞 你做得很好 放松Diane, it's a compliment. You did a good job. Relax.

并且我知道她的女儿是奥柏林的大四学生and I know her daughter is a senior at Oberlin.
你怎么 我还知道三年前 How? And I know you went to Oberlin
你抽风时去过奥柏林during your bender three years ago
因为一堆学生在脸书上发了你的照片because a bunch of students posted pictures of you on Facebook.
老天 你干嘛对我这么痴迷 Jesus Christ, why are you so obsessed with me?
我才不是痴迷I am not obsessed.
我想知道发生了什么 而你不告诉我I wanted to know what happened, and you wouldn't tell me.
你从没问过 好吧 我现在问 You never asked! Okay, so I'm asking now.
在新墨西哥州发生了什么What happened in New Mexico?
你们好 请为芬兰雅虎笑一个Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland!
我不明白的是 为什么你觉得What I don't understand is why you feel like
你有权知道我所做过的每一件糟心事you deserve to know every shitty thing I ever did.
不是有权知道I don't deserve anything.
是我想要知道你做过的糟心事I would like to know when you've done shitty things.
这和你有什么关系Why is that your business?
因为我是你的朋友 我关心你Because I'm your friend, and I care about you,
我为你写了一本书and I wrote a book about you,
现在还为你写了一部剧and now I wrote this show for you,
在外界看到我和你是密友and I am very publicly your friend,
所以如果你的破事传出去了so if it gets out that you're doing creepy stuff,
会让我脸上无光that makes me look bad.
所以你担心我可能做过的事Oh! So you're worried about things that I may have done
是怕会牵连到自己because you think that it reflects badly on you?
损害你的形象 这就是你的道德制高点Hurts your brand? That's your moral high ground?
这与"道德制高点"无关This is not about "Moral high ground."
想知道新墨西哥州的事Wanna know about New Mexico?
想知道我在You want to know about the

发生或没发生过的见不得光的事that I can barely even remember
因为我不是嗑药了就是喝高了'cause I was high or drunk or
而且已经过去年了it was years ago?
对这些你一点都不感到羞愧吗And you don't feel bad, about any of this stuff?
我当然觉得羞愧 我花了太多时间来羞愧Yeah, of course I do! I've spent so much time feeling bad.
对了 大部分的女人 恐怕早就忘了By the way, most of these women... don't even remember, I bet.
对你来说可真方便Well, that's really convenient for you.
我才是背负这一切的人I'm the one who has to live with this shit.
我不得不被内疚折磨 日日夜夜I'm the one who has to feel the guilt all day, every day.
所以你才是受害者So, you're the victim here?
对 我知道这不是最开明最进步Yeah, and I know that's not the woke, progressive,
最对所有人恰当的话 但是我得说 没错intersectionally appropriate thing to say, but I would say, yeah!
马男波杰克的所作所为I'm the one who has suffered the most
导致受苦最多的人就是我because of the actions of BoJack Horseman.
你受的苦 没错 You've suffered? Yeah, I have!

我是认真的 给我解释一下 I'm serious. Explain to me...
萨拉·琳用药过度怎么就让你很难过了how Sarah Lynn's overdose was really rough for you.
闭嘴 你感觉很愧疚吗 Shut up. You feel a lot of guilt about that?
你感觉很愧疚是因为You feel a lot of guilt because

当她向你求助时 你...and when she came to you for help, you
你们好啊 玩得开心吗 Hey, how you doing? You folks having a good time?
你们看上去很棒 谢谢你们的到来You look great. Thanks for coming.
你和她上床 那...不 You had sex with her? That's ! No.
然后等她清醒了 你带她寻欢作乐了一个月And then when she was sober, you took her on a monthlong bender?
然后她死了 她已经死了 你还活着And then she died. And she is dead now. And you're still alive.
还有一个活的女友 还有电视剧With a girlfriend, who is also alive, and a TV show.
而这一切对于这故事的主人公And that's been really hard for you,
对你来说 非常艰难the main character in this story.
你为什么又要提这破事 你觉得很好玩吗Why are you bringing this shit up? Is this fun for you?
反复提... 这不好玩 To really rub in It's not fun.
你赢了 你的每个论点都赢了You win! You scored all the points in the argument!
从事实来看你是对的 我是错的 一如既往According to facts, you are right and I am wrong, like always.
但你知道吗 我不在乎But you know what? I don't care.
因为我想向前看Because I'm trying to move forward.
你一点都没有变You haven't changed at all.
是的 恭喜你 你是最后一个发现的人Yes! Congratulations! You are the last person to get that.
我不会变得 我不需要你帮忙改变I'm not gonna change. I don't need your help for changing,
所以不用再对我费心了so you can stop trying to make me your project.
我不是... 我遇到你时我很难过 That's not When I met you, I was depressed
因为我不喜欢我自己because I didn't like myself.
而当你写了那本书 卖出了上亿本And when you wrote that book and sold a bajillion copies,
你告诉我就算我这么烂 也没有关系you taught me that as screwed up as I am, that's okay.
是你告诉我的 现在我没事了You did that. And now I'm okay.
我觉得不是这样的I don't believe that's true.
我觉得你也不认为是这样的And I don't think you believe it's true.
我觉得你希望我告诉你你会变得更好I think you want me to tell you that you can be better.
就算你现在是个彻头彻尾的混蛋And even though you're being a total asshole right now,
我还是相信你I still believe it.
如果你从这段友谊中只认识到If all you've gotten out of this friendship,
你应该接受你自己现在的样子is the idea that you should be okay with yourself, as you are,
那我觉得这段关系对我们俩来说then I don't think this is a good relationship...
都不好for either of us.
戴安 拜托 我要回家了 Diane, come on. I'm going home.

她带着一个女儿结婚了She was married with a daughter.
但那不是...你想象的那样But it wasn't like... what you're thinking.
她岁了 在新墨西哥可以发生性关系She was , which is the legal age of consent in New Mexico,
而且她没有喝醉 所以and she wasn't drunk, so,
不是说我想 我从来没有...我也没有not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.
这才是最蠢的 我什么都没做That's the dumbest part of all of this! I didn't do anything.
你觉得这件事情这么严重都是因为...I mean, the fact that this has turned into such a thing for you
也许我没有告诉你you know, maybe I didn't tell you
是因为没什么好说的because there was nothing to tell.
你有没有想过 她是我朋友的女儿Did you ever think of that? She was my friend's daughter,
她想要 而我...and she wanted it, and I was...
我当时也很糟糕 因为夏洛特...I was in a bad place because Charlotte had just

但我内心中仍然有隐隐的不安But I still have this little rancid itch
觉得有点不对劲saying something isn't right.
好像在地平线那一头It's like there's always something lurking
总有东西在盘旋just beyond the horizon.
麻烦警探菲尔伯特Philbert the Troubled Detective.
好的 谢谢I see. Thank you.
你为什么还用固定电话Why do you still use a landline?
我该怎么和她说我只是一个怀旧的人What am I supposed to tell her, I'm just an oldfashioned guy?
或者我喜欢连在墙上的东西Or maybe I like things that are plugged to the wall?
如果我要飘走时能抓住的东西Something to grab onto if I start floating away.
那是我妻子的固定电话That was my wife's landline.
我很抱歉 没关系 I'm so sorry. Never mind that.
局长被杀害了The chief's been murdered.
菲尔伯特 这太可怕了Oh, Philbert, that's awful.
我知道你一点都不希望看到他被杀I know how much you didn't want him to be murdered.
萨西 穿上裤子 你的屁股很美Sassy, put on some pants. You've got a sweet bottom,
但我现在只想but the only bottom I'm interested in right now
将这个案子查个底朝天is the bottom of this case, and getting to it.
因为这次 是内部的Because this time, it's personnel.
卡Cut!
你希望我说"这次是私事"吗Did you want me to say, "This time it's personal"?
不 那太老套了 你要说这是有内鬼No, that's a cliche. You're saying it's an inside job.
警局的人干的 "这次 是内部的"Someone on the force. "This time, it's personnel."
好吧 掐脖子戏太假 Ah, okay. The strangling looks fake.
也许这样能更可怕...我这样说话Ooh, maybe it would be scarier... if I talked like this
我跟你说过了 不要发出吓人的声音I already told you. No spooky voice!
你想要我翻白眼吐舌头吗Do you want me to roll my eyes back and stick my tongue out?
好的 我们试试Yeah, let's try that.
吉娜 你发现这些新剧本奇怪的地方了吗Gina, you noticed anything funky about these new scripts?
发现了 戴安不在Yeah. Without Diane around
没人提醒弗利普怎么用"确实"了to police Flip's use of the word "Literally,"
我还以为不会再看到"确实店"[似酒水]了呢you'd think "The literally store" was going out of business.
举个例子Figuratively.
什么 不 我是说局长的故事What? No. I mean the story with the chief.
我觉得是在抄袭我的人生I think it's stolen from my life.
我也有个死去的男性上司 赫比·哈萨克I mean, I also had a male boss who died. Herb Kazazz.
看起来是个巧合Seems like a coincidence.
局长的名字叫巴兹尔The chief is named Basil.
音同罗勒 那是一种药草 音同赫比Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.
我觉得没人会在I just don't think anyone would
不告知你的情况下用你的故事use a story from your life without telling you.
戴安就会 她不再继续写剧本了 Diane would. She's not writing on the show anymore.
你觉得弗利普看了她的书吗You think Flip read her book?
等等 "她的书"连起来就是"赫比的书"Wait a minute. "Her book." "Herb... ook."
你怎么回事 我要把这查个底朝天 What's going on with you? I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
因为这一次是我的事because this time, it's business.
私事Personal business.
朋友 你的创意是哪儿来的Hey, friend. Where'd you get your ideas from?
我就是...对你的创作过程很感兴趣I'm just I'm so interested in your process.
你是自己编的呢Do you make them up,
还是受到其他人生活的...启发or get inspired by other things or people's... lives?
你想指控我什么What are you accusing me of?
你觉得我自己想不出什么主意吗You think I can't come up with my own ideas?
那些卖棒冰的可是签了授权书的Those popsicle guys signed a release.
卖棒冰的Popsicle guys?
你在说什么 你在说什么 What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
有点不对劲 我肯定是唱了《疯狂》Something's going on. I must be singing a song called "Crazy"
因为大家都觉得我是懦夫because everyone's treating me like a patsy.
我只能确定弗利普有所隐瞒All I know for sure is Flip's hiding something.
关于"卖棒冰的"Something about "Popsicle guys."
伙计 你没事吧 没事 Hey, buddy. Is everything okay in here? Yeah, fine.
真的吗 因为这拖车可是黄貂鱼里欧塔的Really? Because this trailer belongs to Stingray Liotta.
看来我有点走神了Oh. Uh, I guess I've been a little distracted.
你确定你没事吧 因为你是我朋友Are you sure you're okay? Because you're my friend,
如果你出了什么事 影响到我们的日程and I would never forgive myself if something happened to you
我绝对不会原谅我自己的that affected our ability to stay on schedule.
什么 波杰克 我在乎你 What? BoJack, I care about you,
以及其他个如果你崩盘and also the other people who will be out of a job
就会丢掉工作的人if you spin out like you usually do.
你能振作起来吗Now are you keeping things together?
别担心Don't worry.
我不会毁掉你的这个职业机会I'm not gonna screw up this professional opportunity for you.
谢谢你的担心Your concern is very touching.
你一直在服用的这些药是什么What's in those pills you keep taking?
如果你真的关心的话How about if you really cared,
我从楼顶摔下来的时候你就应该在场you should've been there the day I fell off a building?
但是没有 你有更重要的事要做But no. You had other important business to attend to.
波杰克 你做得很棒 BoJack You're doing a great job,
让我觉得你好像在乎似的making me feel like you give a shit.
你会成为一个很棒的妈妈You're gonna be an awesome mom.
我觉得你工作太久了I think you're overworked.
真的吗 我要再加上一句Oh, for real? With a side order of,
"你这么认为吗"和各种各样的反驳"Ya think?" And sundry retorts of that fashion.
接下来这样吧Here's what's gonna happen.
你今天晚上回去休息You're gonna take the rest of the night off.
你要好好睡一觉You're gonna get some sleep.
等你回来 你要保持敬业状态And when you come back, you're gonna be professional,
你要有基本礼仪you're gonna be courteous,
你得给我找回你的状态and you're gonna have your shit together.
好吧 我很抱歉 不该说关于妈妈的事Fine! And... I'm sorry, about the mom thing.
去睡觉吧Get some sleep.
我睡不着 对 你说过了 I can't sleep. Ugh. Yeah, you mentioned.
弗利普表现很可疑 没错 八小时前 Flip was acting very suspicious. He sure was. Eight hours ago.
但我们现在回家了 已经凌晨四点了But we're home now, and it's : in the morning.
卡洛琳公主对我指手画脚的Princess Carolyn's getting all up in my business!
她说我看上去"不行" 要"崩盘"She told me that I seem "Not okay," And was "Spinning out,"
"能做一个好妈妈" 你应该不会做好妈妈 and "Would make a great mom." Not sure you'd be the best mom.
我会成为一个完美的妈妈I'd be a wonderful mother!
小心 波杰克Watch it, BoJack.
你失控了 对吉娜好[酷]点You're losing it. Gotta be cool for Gina.
酷的人一般会怎么说What's something a cool person would say?
哥们儿Uh, hey, DaddyO.
我要去厕所了Gotta splitsville to the lavatory
如果你懂我意思的话 开心if you catch my drift. Hang ten!
好吧 搞定 Oh, okay. Nailed it.
波杰克 我知道发生了什么BoJack, I know what's going on.
是吗Uh... you do?
你带着角色回家了You're taking the character home with you.
每个演员都会这样It happens to every actor.
我曾经在《她低语死亡》的试播集中I played a girls' PE coach who solved mysteries
扮演一个解决神秘事件的女子体育教练in a pilot called, Death, She Whistles.
没拍成剧 但是我过于沉迷It never went to series, but I got so into it,
我好几个月看到有孩子骂人就抓住I spent months ordering every mouthy teen I saw
要他们给我元 也许你说得对 to drop and give me . Yeah, you're probably right.
{\an\bord\fs\b}你做了坏事 我要说出去
波杰克迷案未完待续The BoJack Mysteries will continue after this.
大家好 希望你们喜欢《菲尔伯特》Hello. I hope you're enjoying Philbert.
大家都看得开心吗Is everyone having a good time?
我就知说了吧 我现在面临了困境Okay, I'm gonna level with you. I'm in a real situation here
因为我没有意识到because I did not realize
我应该为这部剧卖广告I was supposed to sell ads for this show.
没有人明确和我说过Nobody specifically told me
这属于广告销售总裁的职责范围that was under the purview of the president of ad sales!
所以如果有人想要买价值三千万的广告时间So, if anyone wants to buy million dollars'worth of ad time,
或者办理一些什么证or work out some sort of licensing arrangement,
基本上来说 你只需要知道basically, what you need to know about me
我现在很绝望 什么都答应is I am desperate and will say yes to anything.
开始谈判吧Let the negotiations begin!
现在 回到剧中And now, back to the show.
{\an\bord\fs\b}你做了坏事 我要说出去
这是谁寄的 他们知道什么Who sent this? What do they know?
他们知道吗 我们查一查Do they know things? Let's find out.
波杰克 《洛杉矶公报》今天来吗Hey, BoJack! Did the L.A. Gazette come today?
我在他们《名以上以下成功人士》名单上Apparently, I'm on their " Over but Under " List.
没有 今天没东西到 我没在找东西Uh, no, nothing came today! I wasn't looking at anything.
你为什么这么坚持今天有东西会到Why are you so insistent that something came today?
这么想要到吗Obsessed with things coming much?
这变态手里的料可能会毁掉这部剧Whatever this creep has on me could ruin the show,
那吉娜刚刚拥有的幸福也会化为乌有And there goes Gina's newfound happiness.
我必须查出这是谁寄的 为了她I gotta find out who sent this. For her sake.
这案子就像《真爱至上》 毫无头绪This case is like the movie, Love Actually. No leads.
希望验尸官能帮我们 她会的 Hope the coroner can help us out. She will.
我和验尸官有过不少交情呢We got a lot of history, me and the coroner.
这是照片 她曾经是我的密友之一Here's a picture. She used to be one of my closest friends.
曾经Used to?
时过境迁了Times change.
戴安 戴安 我知道字条是你寄的Diane! Diane! Diane! I know you sent me the note!
什么字条 什么字条 What note? What note?
你塞进我门缝的这一张The one you slipped under my door.
伟大的演员会渗透到角色中See, great actors embody their roles,
我学到了一些侦查技巧so I've picked up some detective skills.
那个字母"I"用的是很呆的字体That letter "I" Is in a nerd font.
我敢说是从《信徒》上剪下来的I'd say it's from The Believer.
只有你会读《信徒》And you're the only person who reads The Believer.
首先 《信徒》是非常流行的元杂志First of all, The Believer is a very popular $ magazine.
以及这张傻乎乎的字条不是我给你的And I didn't send this dumb note.
我喜欢给我揭晓秘密 还不分享你的馅饼You love revealing my secrets. And not sharing your cobbler!
还有谁会这么做Who else could have done it?
我不知道 你惹了谁I don't know. Who'd you piss off?
她说得对 很多人都和我有恩怨She's right. Lotta people have it out for me.
但是谁会想杀害局长呢But who the hell would want to hurt the chief?
菲尔伯特 这是你朋友吗Hey, Philbert. This your friend?
第二名被绞死的受害人A second strangling victim.
如果是同一名杀手 那他真的是钟爱脖子If it's the same killer, he's a real pain in the neck.
就算你是萨西Hey, there's being sassy,
也得注意幽默的界限 确实的and there's going over the line with humor. Literally.
不说相劝了 赶紧列嫌犯名单吧All right, enough chokes. Let's put together a list of suspects.
好的 嫌犯Yeah, suspects.
得振作起来调查嫌犯Gotta keep it together and go through the suspects.
谁会想干掉马男波杰克Who would wanna take down BoJack Horseman?
{\an\bord\fs\b}夏洛特
不 别打给夏洛特No. Don't call Charlotte.
这是个坏主意 别这么做That's a terrible idea. Don't do it.
你好 我是夏洛特的丈夫凯尔Hello! Charlotte's husband Kyle here!
喂 喂喂喂Hello? Hello, hello, hello?
这是你最后的机会This is your last chance, okay?
三 二Three, two...
好吧 再给你一秒钟 怎么回事All right, you get another second here. What's going on?
我在为有线公司进行一次调查 好吧 I'm doing a survey for the cable company. All right.
我有时间做调查 想到大公司I've got time for a survey. Kinda fun to think
还关心小小的老凯尔的想法还真是不错bigtime corporations care about what little old Kyle thinks.
从一到十On a scale of one to ten,
你认为你的有线服务能打几分how would you rate your cable service?
好难 这么直奔主题 让我想想Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat. Let's see.
别太往心里去 但我要打八分Don't take this personally, but I'm gonna say eight.
从一到十 你的婚姻怎么样And on a scale of one to ten, how is your marriage?
这问题有点私人了 你不觉得吗Well, that's a little personal, don't ya think?
好吧Oh, okay. Uh...
但如果能帮助你的调查...But I guess if it helps your survey
我和我的妻子有过争吵my wife and I had some rough patches,
但现在都过去了 我们感情更好了but we're stronger now we've got through them.
我会打八分 那听起来你的妻子 I'm gonna give us an eight. Okay, so it sounds like your wife
并没有沉迷于想要向她的一个老朋友复仇isn't obsessed with a desire to exact revenge on a former friend?
什么 为了跟有线相关的原因 What? For cablerelated reasons or otherwise?
我想没有 完美 I don't think so. Okay, wonderful.
从一到十On a scale of one to ten,
你如何评判你女儿的性成熟程度how would you rate your daughter's sexual maturity?
天啊 这好难Boy, that's a sticky one.
我只是在照着念而已I'm just reading what's in front of me.
我不知道该怎么评判Pfft. I don't even know how to judge that.
一分是"被一个她信任的Uh, let's say that one is, "Horribly scarred
年长之人的举动吓到by an older man she trusted
现在正准备and is now dedicated to
说出他所做的事"getting the word out about the bad thing he did,"
十分是"慢慢在闲暇之余and ten is, "Slowly explored her body
开始健康地探索自己的身体in a healthy way on her own timetable
现在的情绪已经完全调整好了"and is now completely emotionally welladjusted?"
我不知道 大概八分吧I don't know, maybe eight?
我觉得我好像默认都打八分I feel like I'm kind of defaulting to eights.
谢谢 再见Okay, thanks, bye!
等等 别挂 我还有几个问题Wait! Don't go. I got a couple questions.
第一个问题 网飞是几号台Question number one. What channel is Netflix?
我得回苏格兰了 你最棒了 狗狗Gotta get back to Scotland. You're the man now, dawg.
不行Well, that didn't pan out.
我们没有线索 橄榄花园也不送外卖We got no leads, and the Olive Garden won't deliver.
你在那儿的时候还叫你"家人"Sure, when you're there, you're "Family."
我们肯定遗漏了些什么There's gotta be something we're not seeing.
这些受害者都是被掐死的All these victims, strangled.
这案子真是越来越悬了Yeah, this case just gets strangler and strangler.
你还说双关语You made puns!
如果只发生两起命案 你可以笑一笑You could laugh after two murders.
但现在我们面对的是But now we're talking about
五天内被杀的八名无辜的人eight innocent people killed in five days!
这个人真是火力全开This guy's really going full throttle.
我觉得我这样做更好笑吧I guess it's just funnier when I do it.
重点是 我们必须阻止他The point is, we have to stop him.
会寄这张字条的可能有很多人So many people could have sent that note.
为什么有这么多人恨我Why do so many people hate me?
再贴一张里斯平·格洛弗的照片Oh, put up a picture of Crispin Glover.
有一次我在他梦中把咖啡撒到他衣服上了Apparently, I spilled coffee on his shirt in a dream he had.
我觉得制片助理I'm not sure production assistants
应该不用帮忙列死敌名单吧are supposed to help make lists of enemies.
如果你要这么抱怨Hey, if you're gonna whine like that,
那就把你自己的照片也贴上去put your own picture on the wall too.
该死 几点了 我得去片场Oh, shit, what time is it? I gotta get to set.
我们就在片场We are on set.
对 我们就在片场Oh, yeah. We are, in fact, on set.
我告诉你 波杰克盯上我们了I'm telling you, BoJack's onto us!
他谁都盯Oh, he's not onto anything.
我觉得他知道卖棒冰的那个人了I think he knows about the popsicle guys!
什么 小腌瓜 今晚的晚餐 Wha? Pickles, about dinner tonight,
我是有凯尔·柏海莫参演剧的网络台吗am I any network with a show starring Kyle Bornheimer?

爱一夫一妻制Love being monogamous!
波杰克Hey, BoJack!

有人有所隐瞒 你怎么知道的 Someone is hiding something. How did you know?
你和戴安聊过了吗 我找戴安聊过了 Did you talk to Diane? Yes. I did talk to Diane.
波杰克 我保证那只会发生一次BoJack, I promise it was a onetime thing.
我最不希望看到The worst thing that could happen
我因此失去你对我的尊重is if I lost your respect over this.
我受不了你对我的尊重I couldn't live with myself if your respect for me fell any lower
低于你现在对我的尊重程度than the current level of respect you have for me,
我们都知道现在很高which as we both know is very high.
我们能不能假装这一切都没有发生过Can we just pretend this whole thing never happened?
什么一切 谢谢你 What whole thing? Thank you.
肯定有一个简单的解释There's gotta be a simple explanation.
不 我告诉你 一切都腐败了 吉娜No. I'm telling you, this whole thing is rotten, Gina.
你又说吉娜 什么 You said "Gina" Again! What?
你叫她吉娜 角色的名字是萨西You called her "Gina." The character's name is "Sassy."
对 不 这一切都腐败了 萨西Right. Um, no. This whole thing is rotten, Sassy.
不管是怎么回事 我们都会一起查出来的Whatever it is, we'll figure it out together, okay?
好 明早再说 Okay. In the morning.

甚至像双胞胎Twinsies, even.
弗里茨 你不是真的 这感觉够真吗 Fritz, you're not real. Does this feel real enough for ya?
你不用这么做的 你可以信任我You don't have to do this. You can trust me.
我信任你I do trust you.
但我不信任她But I don't trust her.
所以我还用固定电话And that's why I still have a landline.
怎么回事 我睡得很沉What's going on? I'm a heavy sleeper.
一切都开始拼凑起来了 确实The pieces are starting to fit together. Literally.
他有不愿意告诉我的秘密 他还不是一个人He's got a secret he won't tell me. And he's not alone.
所以她一直来看我That's why she keeps checking on me
确保我不会太过于接近真相to make sure that I'm not getting too close to the truth.
还有谁参与Who else is in on it?
花生酱先生 他有什么事Mr. Peanutbutter. He's up to something.
一些关于...戴安的事Something involving... Diane!
但是他们都有什么But what do they all have in...
共同点Common?

维持了弗利普原版的风味maintains the dignity of Flip's original vision.
"哎哟 真爽""Oopsie, gotta poopsie"?
听起来像是菲尔伯特会说的话 对吧That sounds like a thing Philbert would say, right?
我们还做了一款桌游 午餐盒We're also doing a board game, a lunchbox,
还和全国连锁玉米饼店联合推出产品and a campaign with a national taco chain.
"菲尔伯特饼" 美味到让你忘记杀了妻子The "Philburrito." So zesty, you'll forget your murdered wife.
所以这字条是你写的So, you wrote the note!
不 那是 告诉我真相 查韦斯 Uh, no, that's Tell me the truth, Chavez!
你是不是一直都在暗中嫉妒我Have you always been secretly jealous of me?
你痛恨你是个小人物 而我是个成功的警察Did you hate that you were a nothing and I was a successful cop?
你打造这部电视剧就是为了毁了我吗Did you create this entire television show to destroy me?

最后我决定不把孩子交给你and I decided not to give you my baby?
我当然记得你 莎迪Of course I remember you, Sadie.
可惜我现在不太方便Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.
总之 我在想Anyway, I got to thinking...
我面试了很多领养候选人I interviewed a lot of people for adoption.
他们一旦被我拒绝After I said I wasn't gonna give them the baby,
就变得冷漠又恶毒They all went cold or nasty.
除了你 你依然很友好Except you. You were still nice.
我认为这是个预兆[停车标志]I think that's a sign.
你多快能赶到伊甸 为什么 How fast can you get to Eden? Why?
我男朋友甩了我 我妈偷了我的卡车My boyfriend left me, my mama stole my truck,
而我不想要这个孩子了and I don't want this baby no more.
天啊 莎迪Oh, fish, Sadie.
我现在有些抽不开身I'm kind of in the middle of something now.
你抽不开身You're in the middle of something?
我才是从宫缩中抽不开身I'm about as deep in contractions as an apostrophe!
我知道 这一切都太突然了I know. This is all just coming so fast.
我 我等下再打给你I... Let me call you back.
好吧 但如果这个孩子冒出来了而你不在Okay, but if this baby pops out and you're not here,
我就把它扔进垃圾堆I'm putting it in a dumpster.
开玩笑的 我就把它交给别人I'm kidding, I'm giving it to someone else.
我总是忘记这里有多小多狄更斯风I always forget how tiny and Dickensian this place is.
你不需要奢侈享受就能活得幸福真是太好了It's really great how you don't need nice things to be happy.
对 我同意 你来干什么Yes, I agree. What do you want?
过去的几个月 我一直用工作来转移注意力For the last couple months, I've had work to distract me,
但是现在我们被勒令停工了but now that we're on strangle hiatus,
我就无法停止去想"那件事"了I can't stop thinking about that "thing"
那件发生在《菲尔伯特》首映当晚的事that happened in the night of the Philbert.
"勒令停工" 戴安 不要跑题 "Strangle hiatus?" Diane, stay on topic.
你知道我说的是"那件事"吧 知道 You know what "thing" I'm talking about? Yes.
我们之间的事 明白 The thing between us? Got it.
我们上床的事When we had sex?

对 我记得Yep, I remember.
小腌瓜毫不知情 我从未感觉如此罪恶Pickles has no idea, and I've never felt so guilty in my life.
我讨厌保守秘密I hate keeping secrets from people.
仿佛又是罗伯·施奈德的惊喜派对一样It's like Rob Schneider's surprise party all over again.

你背着女朋友出轨You cheating on your girlfriend
和罗伯·施奈德的惊喜派对可不是一回事is not the same as Rob Schneider's surprise party.
你说得对 出轨没那么悲哀 人也比较多You're right, this is much less sad and involves more people.
向小腌瓜坦白吧Just tell Pickles the truth.
我不擅长说坏消息Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.
你说可以吗 什么 不行 Could you do it? What? No!
但是你那么擅长扫人兴致But you're so good at bumming people out.
我更像是"好消息"的类型I'm more of a "good news" guy.
你想让你的前妻向你的女朋友解释You want your exwife to explain the fact
你和前妻有一腿 对她出轨了that you cheated with your exwife to your current girlfriend?
如果描述出来Well, of course every idea
所有主意听起来都很蠢sounds stupid if you describe what it is.
不是只有你对那晚感到恶心You're not the only one who feels gross about that night.
你知道你走后我有多糟心吗Do you have any idea how shitty I felt after you left?
我让你糟心了 那么So I made you feel gross, and now...
不 不是你让我怎么样 我就是恶心No, you didn't make me anything! I am gross.
我无时无刻不觉得像堆燃烧的垃圾I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.
不是别致小巷里的安逸垃圾桶And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,
而是一艘垃圾船 没有船舵在海上飘荡 but a barge, floating out to sea, with no rudder.
我是一艘无舵燃烧大型垃圾船I am a rudderless burning large garbage barge.
很遗憾你一直这样觉得Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way all the time,
但我通常不这样觉得 而现在 第一次but I don't usually, and now, for the first time ever, I do,
我也有了这样的感觉 这让我无所适从and I don't know what to do with that feeling!

非常好 我也是 非常好 Great! Me, too! Great!
好极了Great!

我不知道 我们对谁开枪了I don't know. We shot some stuff?
一开始是个意外 然后吉娜受伤了There was an accident on set and Gina got injured.
天呐 她受伤了吗 她没事 Oh, my God, she did? She's fine.
但有些片段被泄露出去了 片段 But some footage has gotten out. Footage?
因为事情看起来是那样And because of how it looks,
有些人可能会觉得some people might get the impression
你试图伤害吉娜that you were trying to hurt Gina.
他们会这样觉得 对 They're gonna get the impression. Right.

我很抱歉节目的事变得这么乱I'm sorry things got so messy with the show.
我应该更关照你一点的 我经常没能做到I didn't always look out for you as much as I should have.
我能照顾我好自己 我知道你已经很忙了I can take care of myself. I know you've got a lot on your plate.
只是那领养的流程实在是太疯狂了It's just been so crazy, this adoption process,
但我想一旦我有了一个孩子but I think once I get a baby,
我的生活就不会这么乱了 对吧my life will be less hectic, you know?
当然Oh, sure.
这肯定就是那些新妈妈That is why new mothers
总是看起来又镇定又精神的原因always seem so chilledout and wellrested.

显然就是 那你能不能直接说重点Well, obviously it is, so can you get to your point already?
要是你闭嘴的话我早就说了I was getting to it if you'd quit talking already.
我要说的重点是 不是每个女人都要做妈妈My point is, not every woman is supposed to be a mother.
也许如果你Maybe you'd be happier
放下那个期盼 过着你自己if you freed yourself from that expectation,
更想要的生活 你可能会更开心and just lived the life you'd clearly rather be living.
